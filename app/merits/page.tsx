          Merits
        </h1>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          Merits represent a character’s unique abilities and assets. They can cover anything from her wealth to her uncanny ability to knock out her opponents.
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-l font-medium text-gray-400/80">Renaming Merits</h2>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          Each Merit has a name suggestive of its usage. If you
          want to customize a Merit while still accomplishing the same
          goal, give it a different name. For example, Retainer suggests
          something very specific. However, you could just as easily call
          it Ward, and while it does the same thing in game terms, the
          implication is different. Striking Looks could just as easily
          be called Sex Appeal, Bruiser, or Trustworthy, and give the
          exact same game advantages. Consider renaming Merits to
          help further define your character
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-l font-medium text-gray-400/80">Style Merits</h2>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          Merits marked as Style Merits allow access to specialized
          maneuvers. Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next in
          its sequence. So if a Style Merit has a three-dot maneuver
          and a four-dot maneuver, you must purchase the three-dot
          version before accessing the four-dot.
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-l font-medium text-gray-400/80">Sanctity of Merits</h2>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          While Merits represent things within the game and about
          your character, they’re really an out-of-character resource, a
          function of the character creation and advancement mechanics. Merits often represent things that can go away. Retainers
          can be killed. Mentors can get impatient and stop dispensing
          wisdom. So while Merits may represent temporary facets of
          your character, Merit dotss continue to exist. At the end of
          any chapter where your character has lost Merits, you can
          replace them with another Merit.
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          For example, your character has three-dot Retainer, a loyal
          dog, and an eldritch horror eats that dog out in the woods.
          At the end of that chapter, you may reallocate those Retainer
          dots. You may choose to purchase Safe Place, to reflect your
          character’s choice to bunker down from the monster, and
          perhaps Direction Sense (one dot) so your character is less
          likely to get lost in those woods in the future. When the
          character leaves his Safe Place, you can replace those two
          dots with something else.
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          When replacing a Merit, consider what makes sense in the
          story. Pursue the new Merit during the course of the chapter
          if possible, and make the new tie something less superficial
          than a dot or two on a sheet
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          With Storyteller permission, you may &quot;cash in&quot; a Merit
          voluntarily and replace it with Experiences. This should not
          be used as a way to purchase a Merit, take advantage of its
          benefits, and then cash it out for something else. But if a
          Merit’s run its course and no longer makes sense for your
          character, you may use those points elsewhere
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          Merits such as Ambidextrous, Eidetic Memory and the
          various Fighting Style Merits reflect abilities and knowledge
          that your character has, and therefore shouldn’t be cashed
          in or replaced. Then again, if an Ambidextrous character
          loses his left hand....
