# Heavy Weapons (• to •••••; Style) 
**Prerequisites**: Stamina •••, Strength •••, Athletics ••, Weaponry •• 

**Effect**: Your character is trained with heavy weapons which require strength, wide range, and follow through more than direct speed and accuracy. This Style may be used with a two-handed weapon such as a claymore, chainsaw, pike, or an uprooted street sign. 

**Sure Strike** (•): Your character doesn’t always hit the hardest or the most frequently, but she guarantees a deadly strike when she does hit. You can reflexively remove three dice from any attack dice pool (to a minimum of zero) to add one to your character’s weapon damage rating for the turn. These dice must be removed after calculating any penalties from the environment or the opponent’s Defense. 

**Threat Range** (••): Your character’s weapon is immense and keeps opponents at bay. If you opt not to move or Dodge during your turn, any character moving into your character’s proximity suffers one lethal damage and a penalty to their Defense equal to your character’s weapon damage rating. This penalty only lasts for one turn. This cannot be used in a turn the character is Dodging.

**Bring the Pain** (•••): Your character’s strikes stun and incapacitate as well as causing massive trauma to the body. Sacrifice your character’s Defense to use Bring the Pain. Make a standard attack roll. Any damage you score with Bring the Pain counts as a penalty to all actions the victim takes during their next turn. So, if you cause four lethal damage, the opponent is at -4 on their next attack. 

**Warding Stance** (••••): Your character holds her weapon in such a way as to make attacks much harder. If her weapon’s drawn, spend a point of Willpower reflexively to add her weapon’s damage rating as armor for the turn. This will not protect against firearms. 

**Rending** (•••••): Your character’s cuts leave crippling, permanent wounds. By spending a Willpower point before making an attack roll, her successful attacks cause one level of aggravated damage in addition to her weapon’s damage rating. This Willpower point does not add to the attack roll.
