# Defensive Combat (•)
**Prerequisite**: Brawl • or Weaponry •; choose one when this Merit is selected 

**Effect**: Your character is trained in avoiding damage in combat. Use her Brawl or Weaponry to calculate Defense, rather than Athletics. Your character can learn both versions of this Merit, allowing you to use any of the three Skills to calculate Defense. However, you cannot use Weaponry to calculate Defense unless she actually has a weapon in her hand.
