# Armed Defense (• to •••••; Style)
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Weaponry ••, Defensive Combat: Weaponry 

**Effect**: You’re able to use a weapon to stop people who are trying to kill you. Often deployed by police officers using riot shields or telescoping batons, it’s just as effective while using a chair leg.

**Cover the Angles** (•): Whenever you take a Dodge action, reduce the Defense penalties for multiple attackers by 1. You can apply your full Defense against the first two attacks, suffer a -1 penalty against the third, and so on. 

**Weak Spot** (••): You swing against your opponent’s arm, rather than his own weapon. Use this ability when defending against an armed attacker. If your Defense reduces his attack pool to 0, he’s disarmed. If you Dodge, you disarm your opponent if your Defense roll reduces his attack successes to 0. 

**Aggressive Defense** (•••): Anyone dumb enough to come near you is liable to get hurt. When you take a Dodge action, if you score more successes than any attacker, you deal one point of lethal damage to the attacker per extra success. Your weapon bonus doesn’t apply to this extra damage. Drawback: You must spend a point of Willpower and declare that you are using Aggressive Defense at the start of the turn. You cannot combine this maneuver with Press the Advantage or Weak Spot. 

**Iron Guard** (••••): You and your weapon are one. At the start of each turn, you can choose to reduce your weapon bonus (down to a minimum of 0) to increase your Defense by a like amount. If you take a Dodge action, add your full weapon bonus to your Defense after doubling your pool. 

**Press the Advantage** (•••••): You create an opening with a block, and lash out with a fist or foot. When you’re taking a Dodge action, if your Defense roll reduces the attacker’s successes to 0, you can make an unarmed attack against that opponent at a -2 penalty. Your opponent applies Defense as normal.

**Drawback**: Spend a point of Willpower to make the attack. You can only make one attack per turn in this way.
