# Sleight of Hand (••)
**Prerequisite**: Larceny •••

**Effect**: Your character can pick locks and pockets without
even thinking about it. She can take one Larceny-based instant
action reflexively in a given turn. As well, her Larceny
actions go unnoticed unless someone is trying specifically
to catch her.
