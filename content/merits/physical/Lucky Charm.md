# Lucky Charm (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Resolve • and Occult • or Academics • 

**Effect**: When the chips are down and all seems lost, hunters sometimes need a reason to keep fighting. Lucky Charm represents a symbol into which the hunter has put their faith. Its presence steadies their nerves, strengthens their resolve, and gives them an edge. 

Lucky Charm is a Merit that represents a physical object the character favors. It might be a cross, pentacle, fourleaf clover, coin, amulet, worry stone, favored weapon, etc. This object boosts the character’s resolve in dire situations. Provided the hunter is wearing or holding their Lucky Charm, you may make a Resolve + Composure roll once per session at the beginning of a scene.

## Roll Results 
**Success**: Conditions affecting the character’s mental state do not affect them for the remainder of the scene. 

**Exceptional Success**: Conditions affecting the character’s mental state do not affect them for the remainder of the session. 

**Failure**: No positive or negative effect. 

**Dramatic Failure**: The character believes their luck has backfired and obtains a Condition relevant to the scene at the Storyteller’s discretion. 

**Drawback**: A Lucky Charm may be lost, damaged, stolen, or destroyed. When a Lucky Charm is no longer in the character’s possession, the Sanctity of Merits rule applies. A character can only have one Lucky Charm at a time.
