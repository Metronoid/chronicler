# Seizing the Edge (••)
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, Composure •••

**Effect**: Your character is always ready for a chase. Whether
to escape a threat or hunt down a rival, she’s always geared
and ready to go. She always has the Edge in the first turn
of a chase scene (see p. 84). Additionally, the opponent
must make a successful Wits + Composure roll, as if being
ambushed, or your character does not have to account for
her Speed or Initiative when calculating needed successes
in the first turn.
