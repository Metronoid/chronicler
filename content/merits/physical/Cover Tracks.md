# Cover Tracks (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Survival •• or Stealth •• 

**Effect**: Sometimes, a hunter needs to cover their tracks to avoid being caught by the security guard or worse — by a monster. From obscuring their route through a muddy alleyway to wiping up fingerprints, hunters with this Merit know how to make it seem as if they were never there. The player makes an Intelligence + Survival or Stealth roll after leaving a specific location. On a success, your character wipes all physical traces of a desired target’s movement after they’ve left the scene. Whenever another character tries to investigate the scene afterward, they contest the result with Intelligence + Investigation. On an exceptional success to use this Merit, all traces of suspicious movement are automatically erased to the mundane eye; only those using supernatural powers to investigate the scene afterward may contest your roll. 

This Merit’s effects do not erase significant damage (cracked TV screen) or pieces of evidence (bullet holes in walls or corpses) from a scene. 

**Drawback**: This sought-after ability is known to the supernatural. Monsters may attempt to manipulate or charm the character to Cover Tracks for them. The player may contest this attempt with a Wits + Resolve roll.
