# Masked Scent (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Survival •• or Streetwise •• 

**Effect**: Experienced hunters know all mortals have a scent dangerous predators know how to track. A hunter with this Merit is adept at masking their scent to prevent an antagonist tracking by scent from catching up with them during a chase. On a successful Wits + Survival or Streetwise roll, the character finds something nearby (mud, blood, swamp water, garbage, sewage, oil, etc.) to throw their pursuer off their trail. The characters have the Edge and gain a +1 modifier to all rolls during the chase.
