# Automotive Genius (•)
**Prerequisites**: Crafts •••, Drive •, Science •

**Effect**: Your character knows how to fine-tune a vehicle
to utter extremes. When determining how many modifications
she can add to a vehicle (see p. 98), triple her Crafts
dots instead of doubling them. So, a character with Crafts
•••• could support 12 combined modifications on a vehicle
instead of eight. Additionally, any relevant Crafts Specialties
add one more potential modification to the total.
