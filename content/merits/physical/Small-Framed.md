# Small-Framed (••)
**Effect**: Your character is diminutive. He’s not five feet,
and it’s easy to walk into him without noticing. He’s Size
4, and thus has one fewer Health box. He gains +2 to
any rolls to hide or go unnoticed, and this bonus might
apply any time being smaller would be an advantage,
such as crawling through smaller spaces. Available only
at character creation.

**Drawback**: In addition to the lower Health, your character
might be overlooked or not taken seriously by some people.
