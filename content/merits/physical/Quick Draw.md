# Quick Draw (•)
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, a Specialty in the weapon or
fighting style chosen

**Effect**: Choose a Specialty in Weaponry or Firearms when
you purchase this Merit. Your character has trained in that
weapon or style enough that pulling the weapon is his first
reflex. Drawing or holstering that weapon is considered a reflexive
action, and can be done any time his Defense applies.
