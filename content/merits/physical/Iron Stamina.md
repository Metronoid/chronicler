# Iron Stamina (• to •••)
**Prerequisites**: Stamina ••• or Resolve •••

**Effect**: Each dot eliminates a negative modifier (on a onefor-
one basis) when resisting the effects of fatigue or injury.
For example: A character with Iron Stamina •• is able to
ignore up to a -2 modifier brought on by fatigue. The Merit
also counteracts the effects of wound penalties. So, if all
of your character’s Health boxes are filled (which normally
imposes a -3 penalty to his actions) and he has Iron Stamina
•, those penalties are reduced to -2. This Merit cannot be
used to gain positive modifiers for actions, only to cancel
out negative ones.
