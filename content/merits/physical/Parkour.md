# Parkour (• to •••••; Style)
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Athletics ••

**Effect**: Your character is a trained and proficient free runner. Free
running is the art of moving fluidly through urban environments
with complex leaps, bounds, running tricks, and vaults. This is
the type of sport popularized in modern action films, where
characters are unhindered by fences, walls, construction equipment,
cars, or anything else the city puts in their way.

**Flow** (•): Your character reacts instinctively to any obstacles
with leaps, jumps, and scaling techniques. When in a
foot chase, subtract your Parkour from the successes needed
to pursue or evade. Also, ignore environmental penalties to
Athletics rolls equal to your Parkour rating.

**Cat Leap** (••): Your character falls with outstanding grace.
When using a Dexterity + Athletics roll to mitigate damage
from falling, your character gains one automatic success.
Additionally, add your Parkour rating to the threshold of
damage that can be removed through this roll. Parkour will
not mitigate damage from a terminal velocity fall.

**Wall Run** (•••): When climbing, your character can
run upward for some distance before having to traditionally
climb. Without rolling, your character scales 10 feet + five
feet per dot of Athletics as an instant action, rather than the
normal 10 feet.

**Expert Traceur** (••••): Parkour has become second nature
for your character. By spending a Willpower point, you
may designate one Athletics roll to run, jump, or climb as a
rote action (reroll all failed dice once). On any turn during
which you use this ability, you may not apply your character’s
Defense to oncoming attacks.

**Freeflow** (•••••): Your character’s Parkour is now
muscle memory. She can move without thinking, in a
Zenlike state. The character must successfully meditate in order to establish Freeflow. Once established,
your character is capable of taking Athletics actions reflexively
once per turn. By spending a point of Willpower
on an Athletics roll in a foot chase, gain three successes
instead of three dice.
