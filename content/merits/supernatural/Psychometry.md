# Psychometry (•••) 
**Effect**: Psychometry is the psychic ability to read impressions left on physical objects. Your character can feel the emotional resonance left on an item, or can perceive important events tied to a location with this ability. The ability automatically hones in on the most emotionally intense moment tied to the item. 

Spend a Willpower point to activate Psychometry. The successes scored on a Wits + Occult roll determine the clarity of the visions. For each success, you may ask a single yes or no question of the Storyteller, or one of the following questions. For questions pertaining to specific characters, if your character hasn’t met the person in question, the Storyteller may simply describe them.

• What’s the strongest emotion here? \
• Who remembers this moment the most?  \
• Am I missing something in this scene?  \
• Where was this object during the event? \
• What breaking point caused the event? 

**Suggested Modifiers**: Character has read impressions from this item before (-2), important event happened more than one day ago (-1), more than one week ago (-2), more than one month ago (-3), more than one year ago (-5), item was used in a violent crime (+2), item is only vaguely tied to the event (-2), spirits pertaining to the event are nearby (+3) 

**Drawback**: Once per chapter, the Storyteller can force a Psychometry vision any time an important place is visited, or an important item is touched. This doesn’t require a roll or a Willpower point to activate. The Storyteller can give any information pertaining to the event in question. Additionally, the Storyteller can impose one Condition relevant to the event.
