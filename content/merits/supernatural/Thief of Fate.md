# Thief of Fate (•••) 
**Effect**: Your character is a magnet for fortune and fate. When she’s close to someone, she unintentionally steals their good fortune. If she touches someone, this Merit takes effect unless she spends a point of Willpower to curb the effect for a scene. In the same day, any failures the subject makes are considered dramatic failures. If she’s used this Merit at any time in a given day, she gains four dice any time she spends Willpower to increase a dice pool. 

**Drawback**: Once a victim of this Merit suffers a dramatic failure, he hears your character’s name in the back of his mind. This may inspire scrutiny.
