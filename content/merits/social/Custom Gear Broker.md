# Custom Gear Broker (• to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Socialize •• 

**Effect**: Your character is known locally, or throughout their compact or conspiracy, as the one to see when a character needs hard-to-find modifications and strange equipment. She might do the work herself, or simply act as intermediary, like an under-the-table pawn shop for custom gear. 

Once per chapter, you may swap out any piece of equipment of an Availability equal to your character’s dots in this Merit for any other of the same Availability or lower, without a roll. Additionally, once per story you may treat another Merit’s rating as one higher per dot in this Merit, to a maximum of five total dots, for purposes of acquiring custom gear. This usually benefits Resources, but could apply to others as appropriate, such as Allies or Status.
