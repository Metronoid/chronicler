**Touchstone** (• to •••••) 
**Effect**: Your character has an additional Touchstone. Dots purchased do not reflect a “stronger” Touchstone or one to whom you’re more attached; they indicate how many Touchstones your hunter has. For example, if your character rekindles a friendship with an ex-boyfriend and decides to treat them as a Touchstone, you would allocate one dot. The ex is then treated as your second Touchstone. If, however, they have five ex-boyfriends with whom they’d like to interact, you’d purchase five dots. 

**Special**: Purchased Touchstones do not replace a missing primary Touchstone; they count as secondary or additional. This Merit may be purchased multiple times to a maximum of five.
