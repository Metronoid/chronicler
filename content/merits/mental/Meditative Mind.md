# Meditative Mind (•, ••, or ••••)
**Effect**: Your character’s meditation is far more fulfilling
than for other characters. With the one-dot version of this
Merit, the character does not suffer environmental penalties
to meditation (see p. 75), even from wound penalties.
With the two-dot version, when the character has successfully
meditated, she gains a +3 bonus on any Resolve + Composure rolls during the same day, as she’s steeled
herself against the things in the world that would shake her
foundation.
At the four-dot level, she only needs a single success to
gain the benefits of meditation for the day, instead of the
normal four.
