# Trained Observer (•, or •••)
**Prerequisite**: Wits ••• or Composure •••

**Effect**: Your character has spent years in the field, catching
tiny details and digging for secrets. She might not have a
better chance of finding things, but she has a better chance
of finding important things. Any time you make a Perception
roll (usually Wits + Composure), you benefit from the 9-again
quality. With the three-dot version, you get 8-again.
