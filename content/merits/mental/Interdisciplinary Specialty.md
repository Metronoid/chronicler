# Interdisciplinary Specialty (•)
**Prerequisite**: Skill at ••• or higher with a Specialty

**Effect**: Choose a Specialty that your character possesses
when you purchase this Merit. You can apply the +1 from
that Specialty on any Skill with at least one dot, provided
it’s justifiable within the scope of the fiction. For example,
a doctor with a Medicine Specialty in Anatomy may be able
to use it when targeting a specific body part with Weaponry,
but could not with a general strike.
