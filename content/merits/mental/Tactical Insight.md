# Tactical Insight (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, Survival •• or Streetwise •• 

**Effect**: Your character has a keen eye for reading body language and can anticipate where an antagonist might strike. You’ve quickly scouted the field of battle and are crystal clear on what you should do next. Once per session, after Initiative has been decided, you may roll Wits + Survival or Streetwise. On a success, you may choose when you’d like to take your turn. On an exceptional success, you may also Dodge as a free action.
