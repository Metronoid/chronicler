# Tolerance for Biology (•)
**Prerequisite**: Resolve ••• or Medicine ••

**Effect**: Most people turn away at the sight of blood,
other bodily fluids, or exotic biology. Your character has
seen enough that nothing turns her stomach. When other
characters must resist shock or physical repulsion from the
disgusting and morbid, your character stands her ground. You
do not need to make Composure, Stamina, or Resolve rolls
to withstand the biologically strange. This doesn’t mean she’s
immune to fear; she’s just used to nature in all its nasty forms.
