# Aspirations
Chronicles of Darkness characters start with three
Aspirations. Aspirations are goals that your character wishes
to accomplish. They’re also statements about the sort of
stories you want to tell about your character.

Accomplishing an Aspiration is one of the main ways you
can earn Beats to improve your character. You should aim for
accomplishing about one Aspiration per session. If you are
playing a one-shot, all of your Aspirations should be focused,
short-term goals that you could potentially complete within
that session. If you are playing in a long-running chronicle,
then choosing long-term goals is okay. Ideally, you should
have a mix of Aspirations, some of which can be resolved
in one session, and some which will take many sessions to
accomplish. If you know that your character is going to start
out hitchhiking, “Find a place to stay the night” is a perfectly
reasonable Aspiration. If she recently had a fight with her
girlfriend, “Reconcile with Jane” is a fine Aspiration.

Another important thing to consider when deciding on
your Aspirations is that you want them to be active goals.
They have to be something that you need to do, rather than
something that you need to avoid. For example, “Don’t get
drunk” wouldn’t be a very good Aspiration for a character, but
“Go a day without taking a drink” could be, if your character
would find this to be a struggle.

Aspirations give your character life and direction beyond
the scenario dreamed up by the Storyteller. They make your
character feel more real, give the Storyteller hooks to get him
involved in the story, and establish what your character does
if there isn’t an immediate crisis in front of him.

It is also okay to select Aspirations that your character
doesn’t want, but that you want to see happen to the character. For example, your character almost certainly doesn’t
want to be kidnapped by the man with the gray face that
used to be her father, but that might be a story that you are
interested in seeing. You can choose Aspirations that represent you trying and failing to do something. You can have an
Aspiration like “Fail to find proof of the existence of ghosts,”
or “Fail to reconcile with Jane,” if you think that it will make
a more interesting story. Even though the character has failed
at what she wants, you as the player still get the reward for
completing that Aspiration.

Aspirations are one of the best ways for the players to
signal to the Storyteller what sort of stories they want to
be part of. So, Storytellers, be sure to pay attention to what
Aspirations your players have selected. If you were planning
on a suspenseful, low-key session with little overt supernatural
influence, it might be a problem if all of your players have
chosen Aspirations like “destroy a supernatural threat,” or
“see a monster with my own eyes.” It doesn’t mean you have
to change your plans completely, but you may need to tweak
the session a bit to allow for some details that fit with the
Aspirations a little better. Or you can sit down and talk with
the players, and make sure that you are all on the same page
with regards to the story that you are trying to tell.

## Changing Aspirations
When you first make your character, if you are not entirely
certain what Aspirations to pick, don’t worry about it. You can try to come up with a few basic ones, such as the simple,
easily-accomplished Aspirations mentioned earlier. Or go
ahead and leave a few of your Aspiration slots blank for
now, and define them while you play the first few sessions.
Aspirations are not meant to be a straightjacket or a source
of stress, but a tool to help you play the character that you
want to play.

A character’s Aspirations will also likely change over the
course of the chronicle. If you accomplish an Aspiration, for
example, you should replace it with a new Aspiration after that
session. This is a good thing to work on in between sessions.

Sometimes Aspirations are no longer relevant to a character, even if they haven’t actually been achieved. For example,
if your character has an Aspiration of “reconcile with my
estranged father,” it’s hard to accomplish if he is murdered
in the fourth session of the game (though certainly not impossible, in the Chronicles of Darkness). Or maybe you
find out that your character’s father is somehow responsible
for the eyeless, grinning thing that pulled your mother into
that grove of trees the night she disappeared. At that point,
you may not want to reconcile any more.

If an Aspiration no longer makes sense for a character, a
player can change the Aspiration between chapters with the
Storyteller’s approval. This isn’t an excuse to ditch a goal that
is taking too long to accomplish, but rather is an option to
keep a character’s goals in line with their behavior and the
overall direction of the story.
