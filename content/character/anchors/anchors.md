# **Anchors: Key Personality Traits for Regaining Willpower**
Characters in the game have defining traits known as Anchors that describe their personalities and help them regain Willpower. Mortals have two Anchors: a Virtue and a Vice.

## **Virtue and Vice: Reflecting Personality**
Virtues and Vices reflect a character's personality, not just their morality. Willpower can be regained by acting in accordance with the character's Virtue or Vice. It's important to ensure everyone is comfortable with each other's choices and to avoid duplicates. Anchors usually remain constant but can change with significant events. Avoid using physical traits that are already covered by Attributes and Skills.

## **Virtue: Best Self**
A character's Virtue represents their best self and provides satisfaction when acted upon.

## **Example Virtues:**

**Competitive**: Pushes for excellence and feels thrill from competition. Regains Willpower by competing with someone better.\
**Generous**: Feels best by giving to others. Regains Willpower by sacrificing resources for the benefit of others.\
**Just**: Driven by a sense of fairness and justice. Regains Willpower by setting aside personal goals to achieve justice.\
**Loyal**: Loyal to a group, regains Willpower by refusing to act against the group's interests despite risk.

## **Vice: Comfort in Self-Destructive Behavior**
A character's Vice represents a comfort in self-destructive behavior to avoid confronting emotions and problems. Although it reinforces the character's identity, it's not a healthy behavior in the long-term.

## **Example Vices:**

**Ambitious**: Wants advancement, rank, and authority regardless of merit. Regains Willpower by jockeying for position.\
**Arrogant**: Defines self as "better" than others. Regains Willpower by showing superiority.\
**Competitive**: Needs to win, may cheat. Regains Willpower by indulging in competition at the expense of other important matters.\
**Greedy**: Wants to hoard resources. Regains Willpower by taking advantage and denying resources to others.
