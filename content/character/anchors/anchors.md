# Anchors
All Chronicles of Darkness characters have defining personality traits. These traits not only tell a character who she is,
but also allow her to regain Willpower (for more information on spending and regaining Willpower, see Chapter 2). These
traits are called Anchors. For a mortal character, these
Anchors are her Virtue and her Vice.

## Virtue and Vice
When creating a character, you define her Virtue and
Vice. These words describe key aspects of her personality.
Things like Cruel or Generous work, but a physical description, like Clean wouldn’t. Similarly, you don’t want to pick
a Virtue or Vice that is covered by an Attribute or Skill.
Athletic wouldn’t really make a good Virtue or Vice (though
Competitive probably would). Composed wouldn’t work very
well as an Anchor, as Composure is already an Attribute.

A character’s Virtue or Vice isn’t simply indicative of her
morality. Having a Virtue like Good isn’t really appropriate,
and is kind of boring, to boot. While a character’s Virtue
is definitely a positive trait for her, she should absolutely be
able to fulfill her Virtue while suffering a breaking point at
the same time. Sometimes even our
Virtues can drive us to do terrible things.

When a character acts in accordance with her Virtue or
Vice during a scene, she reaffirms her sense of who she is.
This is a way to regain Willpower during play.

It’s a good idea to make sure that everyone is on the same
page with regards to Virtues and Vices, both in terms of what
they mean for your character, and in terms of everyone being
comfortable with each other’s choices. While you cannot
choose the same trait as both your Virtue and Vice, another
character could have a trait as a Virtue that you have as a
Vice, such as Ambitious. Also, as your Vice in particular will
come up repeatedly during play, you should make sure that
the Vice you select doesn’t make any of the other players
uncomfortable.

A character’s Anchors will likely stay the same for most
of a chronicle. However, Virtue and Vice can change if the
character undergoes an event that alters her life or personality.

## Virtue

A character’s Virtue is her higher calling, the personality
trait that represents who she is when she is being her best.
Behaving in accordance with Virtue gives a character a sense
of satisfaction and re-affirms her sense of self. Acting on a
Virtue is difficult, however.

## Example Virtues
The following are some possible Virtues for characters.
This is not an exhaustive list, it is merely intended to help
you in coming up with your own Anchors for your character.

**Competitive**: Your character always pushes herself to excel
and be the best at whatever she does. It’s not about defeating
others, but about the rush she gets from honest competition,
and the thrill of knowing that she pushed herself further and
faster to stay ahead of her rivals. Regain Willpower when your
character honestly competes with someone who outclasses
her, for stakes that she will feel if she loses. 

**Generous**: Your character feels at his best when giving to
others. He may give to charity or simply lend items to friends
with no questions asked. A generous character may be taken
advantage of sometimes, but he isn’t in it for thanks or hope
of repayment. He gives because other people need. Regain
Willpower when your character is deprived of an important
resource or put at risk because of his Generous nature.

**Just**: A Just character is driven by a sense of fairness and
justice. She wants everyone to get what they deserve, and will
stick her neck out to make sure it happens. Regain Willpower
when the character sets her own goals aside in order to make
certain that justice is done.

**Loyal**: Loyalty to a person or a group is your character’s
guide. This group could be other PCs, a company, a mentor
or family member, their country, or any other group that
makes sense. The character is not necessarily foolish or blind
to the flaws of their chosen group. The character regains
Willpower when refusing to act against the group’s interests
puts him at risk.

## Vice
Vice is a character’s short-term comfort. It is the easy way
out, the personality trait she takes comfort in to avoid confronting her actual feelings or problems. Like Virtue, acting
on a Vice reinforces the character’s sense of herself, even if it
is self-destructive. It still helps relieve stress and allows her to
refresh herself, but it’s not healthy behavior in the long term.

## Example Vices
**Ambitious**: Your character wants to get ahead, to move
up the ladder – no matter what the cost. She wants advancement, rank, and authority in advance of what she actually
has earned. Regain Willpower when your character jockeys
for position or tries to advance socially instead of pursuing
a more useful activity.

**Arrogant**: Your character is good at something, and makes
sure everyone knows it. He defines himself by being “better”
than those around him. This goes beyond justifiable pride
in an ability. The character regains Willpower when he takes
an opportunity to lord his superiority over someone else.

**Competitive**: You character needs to win. Nothing makes
her happier than crossing the finish line first, and nothing
makes her angrier than losing. She may even be willing to
cheat in order to get her victory. Regain Willpower when the
character indulges in a competition that distracts from other,
more pressing, matters.

**Greedy**: Your character wants to hoard resources, keeping them for himself in case they are useful someday. Regain
Willpower when you take an advantage for yourself, denying
it to another character.
