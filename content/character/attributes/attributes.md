# **Attributes: Your natural abilities**

Attributes serve as the basis for most rolls in the game and reflect a character's abilities. There are 9 Attributes divided into Mental, Physical, and Social categories. Each character begins with 1 dot in each Attribute, where 2 dots indicate average ability, 3 dots show above average ability, 4 dots denote exceptional ability, and 5 dots represent the pinnacle of human potential for that particular ability.
