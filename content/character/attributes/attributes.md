# Attributes

Attributes are the basic abilities that every character possesses, and are the foundation for most rolls. There are nine
Attributes, split between the Mental, Physical, and Social
categories. If a rule refers to a “Physical action” or a “Social
roll,” it is referring to an action that uses an Attribute from
one of these categories.
All characters start with one dot in each Attribute, which
is below average for that Attribute. Two dots represents
average ability, three dots is above average, and four dots is
someone who is truly exceptional. A character with five dots
in an Attribute has reached the peak of human potential
within that ability.
