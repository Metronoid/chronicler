# **Merits**

If you have not read the [Character Creation Guide](/character/guide) be sure to do so since it gives a in depth explanation of merits from a character creation perspective. This page gives some extra information such as renaming your merits, letting you know you are free to switch around merit points and how the more advanced style merits work.

## **Renaming Merits**

Rename Merits to personalize and define your character. A Merit's name gives a hint of its function, but you can alter it while still achieving the same outcome.

## **Sanctity of Merits**

Merits represent your character's abilities and assets and can change over time. You can replace lost Merits with another Merit at the end of a chapter if it makes sense for the story. With permission from the Storyteller, you can "cash in" a Merit for Experience points if it no longer fits your character.

## **Style Merits**

Style Merits let your character show growth in a specific area of fighting, driving, or the supernatural. These Merits, indicated by the word "Style" in their cost, have multiple moves that can be bought in order. Each move costs 1 dot, but must be accompanied by enough Merits with matching Style Tags. The moves are organized into tiers, and you need to own the same number of Style Tag Merits as the tier you want to purchase. Not all Merits have Style Tags, but all Style Merits do.
