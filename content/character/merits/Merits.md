# Merits

Merits represent a character’s unique abilities and assets. They can cover anything from her wealth to her uncanny ability to knock out her opponents.

## Renaming Merits

Each Merit has a name suggestive of its usage. If you
want to customize a Merit while still accomplishing the same
goal, give it a different name. For example, Retainer suggests
something very specific. However, you could just as easily call
it Ward, and while it does the same thing in game terms, the
implication is different. Striking Looks could just as easily
be called Sex Appeal, Bruiser, or Trustworthy, and give the
exact same game advantages. Consider renaming Merits to
help further define your character

## Style Merits

Merits marked as Style Merits allow access to specialized
maneuvers. Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next in
its sequence. So if a Style Merit has a three-dot maneuver
and a four-dot maneuver, you must purchase the three-dot
version before accessing the four-dot.

## Sanctity of Merits

While Merits represent things within the game and about
your character, they’re really an out-of-character resource, a
function of the character creation and advancement mechanics. Merits often represent things that can go away. Retainers
can be killed. Mentors can get impatient and stop dispensing
wisdom. So while Merits may represent temporary facets of
your character, Merit dotss continue to exist. At the end of
any chapter where your character has lost Merits, you can
replace them with another Merit.

For example, your character has three-dot Retainer, a loyal
dog, and an eldritch horror eats that dog out in the woods.
At the end of that chapter, you may reallocate those Retainer
dots. You may choose to purchase Safe Place, to reflect your
character’s choice to bunker down from the monster, and
perhaps Direction Sense (one dot) so your character is less
likely to get lost in those woods in the future. When the
character leaves his Safe Place, you can replace those two
dots with something else.

When replacing a Merit, consider what makes sense in the
story. Pursue the new Merit during the course of the chapter
if possible, and make the new tie something less superficial
than a dot or two on a sheet

With Storyteller permission, you may "cash in" a Merit
voluntarily and replace it with Experiences. This should not
be used as a way to purchase a Merit, take advantage of its
benefits, and then cash it out for something else. But if a
Merit’s run its course and no longer makes sense for your
character, you may use those points elsewhere

Merits such as Ambidextrous, Eidetic Memory and the
various Fighting Style Merits reflect abilities and knowledge
that your character has, and therefore shouldn’t be cashed
in or replaced. Then again, if an Ambidextrous character
loses his left hand....

## Using Style Tags 

On one hand, you can choose to purchase the next level of a Fighting Style as usual, for the cost of a single Merit dot. If a Fighting Style possesses alternate maneuvers, you may add the “standard” or alternate maneuver to your character this way. Yet your character might abandon orthodox advancement. If she chooses this route, you may purchase any maneuver for the price of a one-dot Fighting Merit and add it to her abilities. The catch? The character needs to first possess as many Merit dots in the same Style Tag as the rank (in Fighting Style progression) of the unorthodox or extra maneuver she wishes to learn. This investment can take the form of maneuvers (for one dot each) or Merits with a matching Style Tag (which may have variable Merit dot costs). This restriction also applies to characters who wish to learn more than one alternate maneuver in a single style. Style Tags can’t override prerequisite Attribute and Skill ratings, prerequisite maneuvers (such as exist in many Grappling maneuvers), and other special requirements, noted with each style.
