# Weapon and Shield (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Stamina •••, Weaponry •• 

**Style Tags**: Light Melee 

**Effect**: Your character knows how to fight from behind a shield with a one-handed weapon. These maneuvers strike a balance between protection and offense and are used in tandem with others, such as in a Viking shield wall or riot police formation. 

**Shield Bash** (•): Your character slams her shield into an oncoming opponent, disrupting his attack. When Dodging add her shield’s Size to her pool. If she reduces an opponent’s attack successes to 0 then any additional successes inflict bashing damage. 

**Boar’s Snout** (••): Your character throws everything into a forward charge, trusting in her shield to protect her. Using a weapon and shield, your character can all-out attack and retain her shield’s Size bonus to Defense for the turn. If this maneuver is used the same turn by other allies with shields, then add an additional +1 to Defense for each. 

**Pin Weapon** (•••): Your character uses her shield to trap an opponent’s weapon. If an opponent misses a melee attack against your character he is automatically disarmed. 

**Tortoise Shell** (••••): Your character knows how to position herself so that she’s completely protected by her shield. When using a shield she is considered behind cover with Durability equal to the shield’s size plus one for each shield-wielding ally in her immediate vicinity.
