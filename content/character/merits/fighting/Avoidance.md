# Avoidance (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Manipulation •••, Athletics ••, Stealth •• 

**Style Tags**: Movement (Agile) 

**Effect**: Your character’s only goal in a fight is not to get hurt. She tries to create situations where opponents hurt themselves or target her big mean friends instead. There is no formal training for this Style; it’s a mixture of ingenuity and a person’s innate desire to avoid pain. 

**Insignificance** (•): When a fight starts you ease out of sight and try to become a part of the scenery. Make a roll of Manipulation + Stealth – the highest Composure in the room. If successful, your character comes across as very nonthreatening. Unless an opponent perceives no other threats around him whatsoever she cannot be the direct target of his attacks. This effect ends if she attacks or takes any threatening actions during the scene. 

**Coattails** (••): Your character’s reaction to being attacked is to dive behind her bigger friend and let him take care of it. When taking a Dodge action she can designate an ally in close range whose hasn’t attacked yet that turn. Go Prone. If hit by an opponent’s attack, her ally can choose to take the damage. 

**Whack-a-Mole** (•••): Your character makes herself into a tempting target and unsuspecting opponents end up doing more damage to themselves than her. Once per turn you may make a contested roll of Manipulation + Persuasion + Avoidance against an opponent’s unarmed or melee attack roll. If the character gets the most successes the attack does no damage, and instead inflicts the Arm Wrack Tilt on the opponent. 

**Play Dead** (••••): When your character wants to bow out of a combat she makes even the most superficial wounds look fatal. After any attack your character sustained lethal damage from, roll Manipulation + Subterfuge. Opponents require a contested Wits + Composure roll to notice that she’s still alive.
