# Systema (Style, • to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Athletics •••, Wits •• 

**Style Tags**: Movement (Agility), Tactical (Military) 

**Effect**: Your character learns to move with exceptional suppleness, rolling with blows and obstacles. She redirects incoming force not as a technique, but an instinct. These abilities are often taught within Systema, a Russian martial art developed for intelligence services and special operations. It can also reflect the advanced body skills taught by “soft” martial arts such as Tai Chi or Aikido. 

**Rolling** (•): When knocked prone, your character relaxes, tucks, and rolls with the momentum. She easily spins to face any direction she wishes. She doesn’t suffer that usual –2 penalty to attacks while Knocked Down or otherwise prone. If she suffers any damage for falling or impacting against an unyielding surface like the hood of a car, roll her Dexterity; each success removes one point of bashing damage (this is not effective against sources of lethal damage — you can’t roll with impalement). She benefits from this in addition to any other action she might take to mitigate damage. 

**Balance** (••): Your character instinctively aligns her posture and bends with incoming force to keep her balance. Attempts to inflict the Knocked Down Tilt or Drop Prone grappling maneuver must achieve two additional successes. 

**Combat Posture** (•••): Your character’s posture and sensitivity are strong enough to knock down anyone who tests his balance against yours. Your character’s Brawl and Weaponry attacks inflict the Knocked Down Tilt whenever they score successes that equal or exceed the victim’s Strength. If an attack would have already delivered this result (such as with a weapon that inflicts the Knockdown effect) it does so with particular force, inflicting an additional point of damage.
