# Transfer Maneuver (• to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Intelligence ••, Wits •••. Your character must also possess at least ••• dots in both the original and new Skill that the maneuver applies to. 

**Style Tag**: Special; see below. 

**Effect**: Many styles teach unarmed methods as a prerequisite for armed methods, and vice versa. This maneuver allows your character to transfer a maneuver from a Brawlbased Fighting Style to a Weaponry-based Style, or vice versa. The maneuver must not depend on the physical presence of a weapon, in that it can be applied with empty hands. The Storyteller decides which maneuvers are appropriate, though this can only be used on maneuvers worth no more than ••• dots — after that, they’re too specific to the original fighting method. Your character must know the maneuver in its original form, and you must purchase it again, at the same cost in dots and Experience.
