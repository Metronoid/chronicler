# Berserker (Style; • to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Iron Stamina ••• 

**Style Tags**: Attitude (Enraged) 

**Effect**: Your character enters a controlled madness in combat. Whether a believer in the throes of ecstatic fervor or a warrior emulating the Norse berserks, this Style is not about technique but about achieving the right state of mind. 

**The Red Mist** (•): Your character focuses inward, seeking out her source of rage within. By spending a point of Willpower she inflicts the Insane Condition on herself for the remainder of the scene. 

**War Cry** (••): Your character chills an opponent’s blood with her mad howl. Instead of attacking, roll a contested Strength + Intimidation versus opponent’s Resolve + Composure. If your character gets the most successes, her opponent suffers a penalty equal to your successes to any action other than Dodging for the next turn. 

**Manic Brutality** (•••): Your character lashes out with a singleminded determination to destroy. Her all-out unarmed attacks have a +1 bonus to hit specified targets. If she’s using a weapon then she may substitute its Durability for its weapon bonus. Drawback: If she’s using a weapon, then all damage taken by her opponent is also applied directly to the weapon’s Structure.
