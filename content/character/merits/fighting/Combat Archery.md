# Combat Archery (Style; • to •••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Athletics ••, Quick Draw (Bow) • 

**Style Tags**: Archery 

**Effect**: Your character uses a bow for rapid draws that riddle opponents with arrows. She knows how to move across the battlefield while firing from any angle. This Style is about trick shots and using archery in the thick of a fight. It uses a dice pool of Dexterity + Athletics for its attacks. 

**Rapid Nock** (•): Your character has trained herself to have another arrow set and her bow drawn within a heartbeat of her last shot. As long as there is a supply of arrows in reach she can make an attack every turn without taking an action to position them on the string. Also, ignore the bow’s Initiative penalty. 

**Reflex Aiming** (••): Your character knows how to time her shots to hit her opponents and not her allies. Ignore penalties for firing a bow into close combat. 

**Parthian Shot** (•••): Your character feints retreat to lure an opponent in for a close-range shot. The first time in a turn an opponent attempts a close-range attack, you may choose to Dodge as normal. However, any successes in excess of your opponent’s are applied as attack successes with your bow against him. 

**Rain of Arrows** (••••): Your character fires a group of shots at multiple opponents in the blink of an eye. She can attack with a bow as an autofire medium burst with three arrows hitting up to three different targets. Drawback: This maneuver sacrifices distance for speed. Triple all range penalties for medium and long distance. 

**Trick Shot** (•••••): Your character rolls, leaps, and runs along walls while firing arrows in any direction. Your character can fire her bow simultaneously while taking an Athletics action, including maneuvers from Movement Styles. This imposes a –2 penalty to both rolls.
