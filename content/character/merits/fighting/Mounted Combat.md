# Mounted Combat (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Animal Ken •• 

**Style Tags:** Archery, Heavy Melee, Light Melee, Tactical (Police) 

**Effect**: Your character fights from horseback using the animal’s size and maneuverability to make her attacks more effective. While trained cavalry regiments are largely a thing of the past, many police departments around the world still have officers who use techniques like these in the modern day. 

**Steady Saddle** (•): Your character knows how to position herself in the saddle to attack an opponent without risking being dismounted or hurting her horse. Your character gains a +3 bonus to any rolls for staying mounted during combat. 

**Fixed Charge** (••): Your character and her horse charge headlong at her opponent. She gains the benefits from both charging (though you move up to twice your horse’s Speed rather than your character’s) and an all-out attack. Both she and her horse lose Defense for the rest of the turn. 

**Skirmishing** (•••): Your character’s attacks are designed to harass her opponents, moving in range to strike and then out again before the counterattack. Her horse can travel half its Speed before her attack and the rest after as one move. She suffers a –2 penalty to her attack for the turn but both her and her mount gain +2 to Defense. 

**Rearing Beast** (••••): Your character has trained her horse to be an intimidating and dangerous opponent in the thick of combat. Instead of attacking, roll Wits + Animal Ken and add successes to attack rolls made by her horse.
