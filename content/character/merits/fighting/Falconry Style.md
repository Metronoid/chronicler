# Falconry (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: This Merit works in conjunction with any predatory bird of at least Size 2. The character must possess Wits •••, Animal Ken •••, and share the Bonded Condition with the bird. 

**Style Tags**: Creature (Claw) 

**Effect**: Your bird performs incredible feats at your command. You purchase this Merit for your character, who may apply it to any bird she shares the Bonded Condition with after a reasonable amount of time training together. Used for both hunting and sport, this practice has roots going back into antiquity and among numerous cultures. While not as widespread now as in the past, finding a trainer for this style is still relatively easy. Unless otherwise noted, these Merits constitute actions the bird takes independently, with only a simple, one-word or gesture command. Thus, your character does not have to dedicate an action to make them happen. Additionally, possession of this Merit allows your character to spend Willpower to benefit the bird’s actions in her presence. 

**Predator’s Vigil** (•): The presence of your bird instinctively wards off prey animals. Even a flock of pigeons or swarm of rats won’t come too close when a natural predator circles the skies. Any creature of equal or smaller Size than your bird in his immediate vicinity has the Shaken Condition applied to them for any action other than hiding or fleeing the area. 

**Flyby** (••): Your character commands her bird to dive past an enemy at high speed, creating a distraction. Roll Presence + Intimidation against an opponent’s Resolve + Composure as an attack action for the bird. If successful, the opponent takes a –3 penalty to his next action. 

**Retrieve Item** (•••): Your bird knows how to grab small items and bring them back to you, even snatching them from someone’s hand. On your character’s turn she can designate any object of the bird’s Size or smaller within her and her bird’s field of vision that the bird will retrieve. An opponent actively holding onto an item treats this as a Disarm maneuver, but if successful the bird’s roll is automatically considered an exceptional success. This generally requires the bird make an all-out attack. 

**Rake the Eyes** (••••): Your character commands her bird to claw at an opponent’s eyes. Take a –1 penalty to attack. A successful attack applies the Blinded Tilt.
