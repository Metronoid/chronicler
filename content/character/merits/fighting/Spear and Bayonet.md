# Spear and Bayonet (Style; • to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Dexterity ••, Weaponry •• 

**Style Tags**: Pole Weapons 

**Effect**: Your character is trained with long weapons that end in a point. This could be anything from a traditional spear to a fixed bayonet on a modern rifle. This Style has countless variations around the world but is historically incorporated as part of military training. 

**Firm Footing** (•): Your character braces herself with her weapon to skewer a charging opponent. Any opponent attempting an all-out or charge attack against your character takes her weapon’s damage automatically before he makes his attack roll. Armor subtracts from this, but then will not apply to any attacks your character makes in the same turn. 

**Keep at Bay** (••): Your character can threaten an opponent with her weapon to prevent maneuvering. Choose an opponent with a shorter weapon; if that opponent takes any action other than backing away or Dodging he loses his Defense against your character’s next attack. Drawback: Spend a point of Willpower to activate this maneuver. 

**Strike and Develop** (•••): Your character stabs an opponent with her weapon then turns the blade before removing it, leaving a more grisly wound. Attacks made with her weapon that inflict lethal damage causes the victim to bleed out, causing one point of lethal damage for a number of turns equal to her successes on the attack roll. Subsequent attacks can add to the total number of turns but never cause more than one point of lethal damage per turn in bleeding to the victim. She loses her Defense any turn she uses this maneuver.
