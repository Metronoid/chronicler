# Two Weapon Fighting (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, Fighting Finesse ••, Weaponry ••• 

**Style Tags**: Flexible, Light Melee 

**Effect**: Your character fights with a weapon in each hand. She can amplify her attacks by using them together or balance between attack and defense by using one weapon for each. Different martial arts focus on different sets of weapons. Some employ a rapier and dagger, or a katana and wakizashi, while others use sticks or two light swords. This Style can be used to replicate any of them. Unless your character possesses the Ambidextrous Merit she takes the usual –2 penalty for using a weapon in her off-hand. Neither weapon can be above Size 2 for performing these maneuvers. 

**Balanced Grip** (•): Your character knows how to use her weapons so they’re not awkward to hold. Your character does not count her weapons’ Initiative penalties as long as her off-hand weapon’s rating is the same or the lower of the two. 

**Protective Striking** (••): Your character uses her off-hand weapon to deflect attacks. She adds her off-hand weapon’s bonus to her Defense for the first attack made against her in a turn. If her off-hand weapon has no bonus then add +1 instead. 

**Dual Swipe** (•••): Your character attacks with both of her weapons simultaneously against one target. As part of an all-out melee attack, add her off-hand weapon’s bonus to her attack roll and reduce her target’s Defense by 1. If her off-hand weapon has no bonus then add +1 instead. 

**Double Strike** (••••): Your character attacks two different targets simultaneously. Spend a point of Willpower and designate two targets in close range of your character. Take the highest Defense and –1 to the dice pool. Choose which weapon’s damage applies to which target. This maneuver cannot be used with Dual Swipe. 

For example, if you’re up against two opponents with 4 and 6 Defense, and you have a 2L and 1L weapon, you would take –7 to Double Strike (the 6 Defense, with an additional –1). If you rolled three successes, one opponent would take five points of lethal damage, and the other four points of lethal damage — your choice which.
