# Kino Mutai (Style, • to ••••) 

**Prerequisites**: Dexterity ••, Resolve •••, Brawl •• 

**Style Tags**: Attitude (Enraged), Tactical (Street) 

**Effect**: Your character learns to bite opponents, tear at soft tissues and gouge eyes with special skills. This is sometimes called “Kino Mutai” in Filipino martial arts, but it can be learned by anyone uninhibited enough to use these unconventional methods to the greatest extent possible for humans. Thus, this Fighting Style only works for beings with a human body plan and a decent set of teeth. 

**Trained Bite** (•): If your character prevails in a grapple she may bite harder than normal, targeting sensitive parts of an opponent’s anatomy. This acts as the Damage maneuver, but inflicts an additional two points of bashing damage. Vampires, werewolves in humanoid form, and other monsters with particularly potent bite attacks cause one additional damage of the same type (potentially lethal) when using this maneuver. 

**Ripping** (••): Your character overcomes squeamishness and distractions to grab and tear earlobes, eyelids, and other soft, loose parts. She doesn’t pause before ripping out hair by the scalp. None of these injuries are life-threatening, but they inflict pain. If you win a grappling roll with more successes than the opponent’s Resolve, she may use the Ripping maneuver, which inflicts an appropriate Condition like Blinded or Deafened but only inflicts one point of bashing damage. 

**Trained Gouge** (•••): While grappling, your character can drive her fingers into an enemy’s eyes with exceptional force and persistence. If you win a grappling roll and score at least three successes, you may opt for the Gouge maneuver. This inflicts the Blinded Condition, but unlike typical cases your character maintains this Condition until the opponent Breaks Free, Restrains your character, or renders the arm unable to function. 

**Continuous Bite** (••••): Your character knows how to apply pressure, rip flesh, and use the rest of her body’s musculature to enhance a bite. In a grapple, she may inflict lethal damage with the Damage maneuver by tearing off strips of her opponent’s flesh.
