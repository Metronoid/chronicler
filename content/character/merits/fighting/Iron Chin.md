# Iron Chin (•• or ••••) 

**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Stamina ••• 

**Style Tags**: Attitude (Determined), Striking, Tactical (Street) 

**Effect**: Your character’s taken her share of beatings and can’t be scared by pain or the sight of her own blood. This Merit comes in two levels. At •• dots, she no longer suffers the Beaten Down Tilt from any amount of bashing damage. At •••• dots, she never suffers Beaten Down, period. This is probably more foolhardy than brave. If your chronicle doesn’t feature conflicts where Beaten Down features prominently, don’t use this Merit.
