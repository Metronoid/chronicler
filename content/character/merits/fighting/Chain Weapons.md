# Chain Weapons (Style; • to ••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Weaponry •• 

**Style Tags**: Flexible 

**Effect**: Your character knows how to use a length of chain as a weapon. These maneuvers require at least a yard’s (or meter’s) worth of chain and can be any design from a martial artist’s chain whip to one ripped off the sprocket of a motorcycle. The Style is taught among traditional Chinese weapon styles but is also favored among everyday street gangs. 

**Imposing Defense** (•): Your character spins her chain around, creating a whirling metal barrier between her and her opponent. Sacrificing her Defense, and she inflicts her weapon damage rating + 1 in bashing damage to any opponent who attempts an unarmed or melee attack against her that turn. 

**Bring Down the House** (••): Handy in rooms with chandeliers or dodgy support beams, your character lashes her chain around some part of the environment over an opponent’s head and then gives it a good yank. She makes an attack against an object with a penalty for the object’s Size. If successful, she inflicts bashing damage equal to the object’s Structure on all characters within range. Characters with their turn still available can Dodge, with successes removing damage.
