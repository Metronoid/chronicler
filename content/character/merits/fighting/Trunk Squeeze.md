# Trunk Squeeze (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Brawl •• 

**Style Tags**: Creature (Constrictor), Grappling 

**Effect**: By wrapping arms or legs around an opponent’s torso, your character can practically crush the life out of him. While grappling, your character can use the Trunk Squeeze maneuver. 

• **Trunk Squeeze**: Using a bear hug or leg scissors, your character crushes the opponent’s torso, making it increasingly difficult to breathe. This maneuver inflicts one point of bashing damage and imposes a cumulative –1 to the opponent’s grappling rolls for each round she maintains it. The penalty persists until after your character attempts another maneuver, or until the target Breaks Free. This maneuver doesn’t work on anyone who doesn’t need to breathe, or victims with a Size at least 2 higher than the attacker’s.
