# Thrown Weapons (Style; • to ••) 
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Quick Draw with a thrown weapon Specialty • 

**Style Tags**: Light Melee, Agile 

**Effect**: Knives, darts, throwing stars, and tomahawks are all weapons your character can send flying in her enemy’s direction. Many warrior cultures have used thrown projectiles in wartime or for hunting purposes and may teach this Style. Also, similar techniques are found among circus and sideshow acts. These maneuvers may only be performed with edged weapons Size 1 or smaller. 

**Practiced Toss** (•): Your character knows how to throw her weapon with a quick and fluid motion. Add her Athletics score to Initiative when using a thrown weapon. 

**Impalement Arts** (••): A well-placed throw staples an opponent’s limbs to the environment. If your character succeeds in damaging a specified target arm, leg, or hand with a thrown weapon, she inflicts the Impaled Tilt. 

**Drawback**: The heft needed to make her throw penetrate leaves your character vulnerable. She loses her Defense any turn she uses this maneuver.
