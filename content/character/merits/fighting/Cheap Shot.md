# Cheap Shot (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Street Fighting •••, Subterfuge •• 

**Style Tags**: Tactical (Street)

**Effect**: Your character is a master at the bait and switch. She can look off in an odd direction and prompt her opponent to do the same, or she might step on his toes to distract him. She fights dirty. Make a Dexterity + Subterfuge roll as a reflexive action. The opponent’s player contests with Wits + Composure. If you score more successes, the opponent loses his Defense for the next turn. Each time a character uses this maneuver in a scene, it levies a cumulative -2 penalty to further uses since the opposition gets used to the tricks.
