# Fighting Finesse (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, a Specialty in Weaponry or Brawl 

**Effect**: Choose a Specialty in Weaponry or Brawl when you purchase this Merit. Your character’s extensive training in that particular weapon or style has allowed them to benefit more from their alacrity and agility than their strength. You may substitute your character’s Dexterity for her Strength when making rolls with that Specialty. 

This Merit may be purchased multiple times to gain its benefit with multiple Specialties.
