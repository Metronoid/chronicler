# Martial Arts (• to •••••; Style) 
**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Brawl •• 

**Style Tags**: Striking

**Effect**: Your character is trained in one or more formal martial arts styles. This may have come from a personal mentor, a dojo, or a self-defense class. It may have been for exercise, protection, show, or tradition. These maneuvers may only be used unarmed, or with weapons capable of using the Brawl Skill, such as a punch dagger, or a weapon using the Shiv Merit (see below). 

**Focused Attack** (•): Your character has trained extensively in striking specific parts of an opponent’s body. Reduce penalties for hitting specific targets by one. Additionally, you may ignore one point of armor on any opponent. 

**Leg Kick** (•): Your character knows how to kick an opponent’s legs out from under him. She might use a Thai-style round kick or drive her heel into his kneecap. If she reduces her Defense by 1 while concentrating on low kicks, she’ll cause the Leg Wrack Condition if her Brawl attack inflicts at least one damage that turn. She doesn’t suffer the usual penalty for targeting a leg. Note that trying to hit the other leg for a knockdown doesn’t use this maneuver, but the normal rules. However, using Leg Kick on subsequent attacks lengthens the duration of the Leg Wrack by attaching the Condition to additional damage.

**Defensive Strike** (••): Your character excels in defending herself while finding the best time to strike. You can add 1 or 2 points to your character’s Defense. For each Defense point you take, subtract a die from any attacks you make. This can only be used in a turn in which your character intends to attack. It cannot be used with a Dodge. 

**Cutting Elbow** (••): When striking with an elbow, your character targets thin skin in the opponent’s scalp with the aim of ripping it open. She only suffers a –2 penalty to attack when she wishes to inflict the Blinded Condition on an opponent with human-like anatomy because when she hits and inflicts at least one point of bashing damage, blood from the scalp wound washes over the opponent’s eyes. This maneuver may also be purchased through the Tactics (Street) Style Tag.

**Whirlwind Strike** (•••): When engaged, your character becomes a storm of threatening kicks and punches; nothing close is safe. As long as your character has her Defense available to her, and is not Dodging, any character coming into arm’s reach takes one bashing damage. This damage continues once per turn as long as the enemy stays within range, and occurs on the enemy’s turn. If you spend a point of Willpower, this damage becomes two bashing until your next turn. 

**Trapping** (•••): This maneuver has a lot of names, including “sticking hands” or “scissors.” Using it, your character knows how to control her opponent’s limbs so they can’t be used to block incoming strikes. By making limb-to-limb physical contact, she can sense and counter her opponent’s reactions. If she hits with a Brawl attack, she may set aside as many successes as her Brawl Skill and add these to her Brawl attack next turn. If she sets aside all successes, the first attack inflicts no damage, but makes contact for the follow up. She loses this advantage if the opponent leaves hand-to-hand range and she can’t or won’t follow.

**The Hand As Weapon** (••••): With this degree of training, your character’s limbs are hardened to cause massive trauma. Her unarmed strikes cause lethal damage. 

**Inch Force** (••••): Your character knows how to swiftly strike across extremely short distances. She can hit hard with an inch of movement, or smash with a shoulder, hip, or head butt. When an opponent tries to grab your character she’s entitled to one immediate counterattack per turn as an additional reflexive action (multiple grab attempts during the turn don’t entitle her to additional counterattacks). Roll Strength + Brawl – Defense as usual. If the attack scores more successes than the opponent’s Strength, she automatically breaks free of the grab and inflicts standard Brawl damage as well.

**The Touch of Death** (•••••): Your character’s mastery has brought with it the daunting power of causing lethal injury with a touch. If she chooses, her unarmed strikes count as weapons with two damage rating.

**High Momentum Strike** (•••••): Tornado kicks, spinning backfists, and flying knees are hard to pull off, but in the right circumstances can be devastating. If your character has a higher Initiative rank, she may wait for an opponent to attack with a Brawl or Weaponry strike. If the opponent scores 0 successes, your character may attempt an immediate counterattack, using her action for the turn on a leaping and/or spinning attack. If the counterattack hits it knocks the opponent down. In addition, roll the character’s Brawl dots and add it to the attack’s total damage.
