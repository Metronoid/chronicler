# Strength Performance (Style, • to ••••) 

**Prerequisites**: Strength •••, Stamina ••, Athletics •• 

**Style Tag**: Movement (Strong) 

**Effect**: While the Strength Attribute covers all forms of issuing bodily force, your character has specifically trained in lifting, pushing, and pulling enormous weights. He learned this as an Olympic-style weightlifter, strongman competitor, or performer. This doesn’t help your character hit things, but if he does, anything at the other end is going to break and hurt.

In addition to learning maneuvers, at ••• dots your character can actually increase in Size after adding prodigious amounts of muscle. You may purchase the Giant Merit for your character during play, or if he began play as Small-Framed, get back the Experience value of those Merit dots while increasing to Size 5, and losing its benefits. (Your character can’t do one after the other — there’s a limit to what her skeleton can support.) Your character must have had Strength Performance ••• for at least one year, and you must tell the Storyteller your character is trying to get bigger. No character can move from Giant to Size 7 this way, and any Size change is optional — small people can still max out in this style. 

**Strength Tricks** (•): Your character combines trained strength with a practical knowledge of physics to perform impressive, if minor, feats of strength. He can rip phone books in half, bend rebar, and smash bricks with his bare hands. The character benefits from a +2 bonus to Performance and Intimidation rolls where he can demonstrate his talents, and an additional +1 to other non-combat feats of Strength. 

**Lifting** (••): Your character can perform incredible feats of raw strength. When attempting a feat of strength that requires a Strength + Stamina roll, you gain the Rote benefit — re-roll failed dice. This does not aid running, jumping, or combat rolls, but does aid in attempts to damage relatively immobile, inanimate objects. In that case your character gains the Rote benefit on a combat dice pool no larger than his Strength + Stamina. 

**Push/Pull** (•••): Have you ever seen someone pull a tractor trailer or airplane with their teeth? Your character’s all over that. If your character’s goal is to move an object laterally, double her effective Strength. If the object is on wheels or friction has otherwise been minimized, multiply her Strength by 5. Practical considerations may require equipment such as ropes and a harness, and the quality of this equipment may provide a bonus to the roll. 

**Stronger Than You** (••••): If your character succeeds at Strength-based tasks, he does so with an increased level of performance. You don’t gain bonus dice for Strength-related rolls but if you roll at least one success, add +1 success to the total. This does apply to combat, making this character capable of bone-cracking blows and grips.
