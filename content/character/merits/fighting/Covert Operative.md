# Covert Operative (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, Dexterity •••, Stealth •• 

**Style Tags**: Tactical (Military) 

**Effect**: Your character is trained in getting the jump on her opponents. She creeps up on unsuspecting enemies from the shadows and neutralizes them before anyone realizes anything’s happening. When your character ambushes an opponent, the victim loses the 10-again quality on his roll to notice the attack. Even if he successfully notices your character, your character acts at +3 Initiative in the first turn.
