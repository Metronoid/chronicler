# Retain Weapon (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits ••, Brawl •• 

**Style Tags**: Light Weapon, Pistol, Tactical (Police, Military) 

**Effect**: Your character has trained to resist being disarmed. Police and military forces often teach this, but your character might learn this as part of a traditional martial art, as part of a shooting course, or as a member of a private security service. When an attacker attempts to use the Control Weapon or Disarm grappling maneuvers to take his weapon, or otherwise take it away in combat, reduce successes by your character’s Brawl dots.
