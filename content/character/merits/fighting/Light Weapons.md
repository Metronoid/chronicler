# Light Weapons (• to •••••; Style) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits ••• or Fighting Finesse, Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Weaponry •• 

**Style Tags**: Light Melee

**Effect**: Your character is trained with small hand-tohand weapons which favor finesse over raw power. These maneuvers may only be used with one-handed weapons with a damage rating of two or less. 

**Rapidity** (•): Your character moves with swiftness to find just the right spot to strike. You can sacrifice your character’s weapon damage rating to add his Weaponry score to his Initiative for the turn. The weapon becomes a zero damage weapon for the turn. 

**Thrust** (••): Your character knows when to defend himself, and when to move in for the kill. At any time, you can sacrifice points of Defense one-for-one to add to attack pools. This cannot happen if you’ve already used Defense in the same turn. If you use this maneuver, you may not sacrifice your full Defense for any other reason. For example, you cannot use Thrust with an all-out attack. 

**Feint** (•••): With a flourish in one direction, your character can distract an opponent for a cleaner, more effective follow-up strike. For example, if Feinting with a two damage weapon with three successes, the attack causes no damage. However, your next attack ignores five points of Defense, and causes three extra points of damage.

**Flurry** (••••): Your character moves quickly enough to stab opponents with numerous pricks and swipes in the blink of an eye. As long as your character has his Defense available to him (if it’s not been sacrificed for another maneuver, or denied from surprise, for example), any character coming into his immediate proximity takes one point of lethal damage. This damage continues once per turn as long as the enemy stays within range, and occurs on the enemy’s turn. This can affect multiple opponents, and cannot be used in a turn where the character is Dodging. 

**Vital Shot** (•••••): Your character can use his smaller weapon to get into an opponent’s defenses and hit where it hurts most. Sacrifice your character’s Defense for the turn to use this maneuver. If the attack roll succeeds, the attack causes one point of aggravated damage, in addition to the damage rating of the weapon.
