# Bowmanship (Style; • to ••••) 

**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Firearms ••, Trained Observer • 

**Style Tags**: Archery 

**Effect**: Your character is a patient hunter with a bow. She fires precision shots across long distances to take out targets that had no idea she was even there. This Style focuses on a character’s ability to aim by judging distance and trajectory. It uses a dice pool of Dexterity + Firearms for its attacks. 

**Arcing Fire** (•): Your character knows how to tilt her aim to make a shot hit true even from afar. Double range increments, or increase her range band by one degree. 

**Bullseye** (••): Your character places her shots to hit deep into an opponent’s weak spots. When attacking a specified target you may lower your bow’s damage rating to any amount (0 or greater) to add +1 and the 8-again quality to the attack roll. 

**Out of Nowhere** (•••): Your character fires her arrows and then ducks out of sight, leaving her enemies bleeding and confused. Roll Dexterity + Stealth as a reflexive action after attacking a target that is unaware of her presence. Her target must roll Wits + Composure – her successes, where failure applies the Shaken Conditionand the attacker is hidden. 

**Death from Above** (••••): Loose vertical shots to reach opponents behind cover. Reduce their Concealment by 1 per 10 yards (9 meters) added to the shot’s range. Or ignore entirely by reducing range band by one degree.
