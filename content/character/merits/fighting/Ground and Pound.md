# Ground and Pound (•••) 
**Prerequisites**: Brawl •• 

**Style Tags**: Striking, Grappling, Tactical (Street) 

**Effect**: Your character skillfully uses gravity to drop a fist, elbow, knee, or other strike on a prone opponent. When using Brawl to strike or inflict the Damage grappling maneuver on a prone opponent, you may declare your character uses this maneuver. You gain the rote benefit (re-roll failed dice) to your attack, but automatically fall prone; and if grappled, your opponent automatically breaks free.
