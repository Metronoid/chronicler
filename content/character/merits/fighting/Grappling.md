# Grappling (• to •••••; Style)
**Prerequisites**: Stamina •••, Strength ••, Athletics ••, Brawl •• 

**Style Tag**: Grappling

**Effect**: Your character has trained in wrestling, or one of many grappling martial arts. 

**Sprawl** (•): Your character can adjust his weight to defend himself in a grapple. While in a grapple, the character’s opponent cannot apply the Drop Prone or Take Cover moves. 

**Standing Throw** (•): Your character knows how to toss someone over his hip, trip, or sweep her while keeping his footing. He may inflict the Knocked Down Condition as a grappling maneuver, but if he remains standing his opponent automatically breaks free.

**Takedown Maneuver** (••): Your character can take an opponent to the ground rapidly. With a normal roll, you may choose to render an opponent prone instead of establishing a grapple. Also, you may choose to cause bashing damage equal to the successes rolled. 

**Small Joint Manipulation** (••): By accepting a –2 penalty to the attack roll, your character may immediately dislocate or otherwise bend the opponent’s fingers in one hand (or toes in one foot, in some circumstances) the wrong way. This occurs instead of any other maneuver, inflicting one point of bashing damage per two successes (round down, but always at least one) and the Arm or Leg Wrack Condition. If the attack targets a hand, it can no longer hold objects until the associated damage heals. Optionally, you may assign the Tactical (Street) Style Tag to this maneuver to represent a form of “underhanded” fighting.

**Joint Lock** (•••): ou use joint locks and immobilizing tactics to limit your opponent’s movement. You can use the Joint Lock move in a grapple. Next turn, your opponent suffers bashing damage equal to your successes. You can use Joint Lock as a lead-in to the Restrain move. In addition, any successful overpowering maneuvers your character uses cause 1L damage in addition to their normal effects.

**Ippon** (•••): Additional Prerequisite: Takedown Maneuver. While using Drop Prone with the Takedown Maneuver, your character hurls his opponent to the ground with exceptional force. Double the damage of the takedown for the purpose of inflicting the Stunned Condition, but not as actual damage. 

**Dynamic Guard** (••••): While prone, your character uses his body to shake and redirect his enemy. Reduce the opponent’s dice pool to grapple by your character’s Dexterity. Unfortunately, your character can’t get up from prone while using this maneuver.

**Lock Flow** (••••): Additional Prerequisite: Joint Lock Maneuver. When your character’s opponent slips out of one lock you know how to go with the motion and trap her in another. You gain +2 to grapple rolls when you declare ahead of time that you’re attempting a joint lock. 

**Tap or Snap** (•••••): Additional Prerequisite: Joint Lock Maneuver. If your character succeeds in a grapple in the turn after applying the Joint Lock maneuver, he may allow the opponent to choose between accepting the Beaten Down Condition, or suffering an Arm or Leg Wrack (attacker’s choice) and lethal damage equal to the successes scored, as your character breaks or dislocates the relevant limb. 

**Positional Dominance** (•••••): Your character knows how to hurt and tire an opponent from any position, crushing the life out of him. No matter which maneuver you choose on a successful grapple, your character inflicts one point of bashing damage per two successes scored, rounding down, but always inflicting at least one point. If your character chooses a damaging maneuver, add this to the damage inflicted. You may choose not to inflict this damage.
