**Style Tags:** Striking 

**Effect**: Trading blows with the hands dates back to Classical times, and probably earlier — some biologists believe our hands have been optimized to deliver blows. There are hundreds of folk styles of boxing, from West Africa’s Dambe to the Filipino method known as Suntukan or Panantukan. This style concentrates on the modern combat sport, which combines European methods with innovations developed by trainers or borrowed from other cultures. Your character is trained in modern boxing, or a similar traditional style. 

**Head Protection** (•): The head is the primary target for most boxers, so your character has learned to protect it by bobbing, weaving, and angling away from blows. Your character’s Defense increases by 1 against unarmed strikes or weapons that use the Brawl Skill, and attackers suffer an additional –1 penalty to target her head. 

**Defensive Jab** (••): Your character interrupts attacks with well-timed punches from the lead hand. Any time an opponent misses with a Brawl or Weaponry attack, your character inflicts one point of bashing damage which ignores armor. If your character Dodges, change this to one point of bashing damage per two successes that exceed the opponent’s attack successes (a minimum of one, but round fractions down). 

**Knockout Artist** (•••): Your character knows how to knock someone out. She now treats the target’s Size as 1 lower at all times for the purposes of inflicting the Stunned Condition, reflecting her ability to casually hit someone in the head. If you suffer a penalty to target the head as a true specified target, treat the target’s Size as 2 lower for the purpose of inflicting the Condition. 

**Combination** (••••): Your character learns to fire off several blows in rapid succession, so that if one hits, the others often follow. If your character’s Brawl strike succeeds, roll her Dexterity dots as dice and add successes to damage to reflect other blows striking home. 

**Out for the Count** (•••••): When your character knocks someone out they don’t get back up any time soon. When she inflicts the Stunned Condition it not only lasts for a number of turns equal to the damage she inflicted, but it produces true unconsciousness for that period unless the victim spends a point of Willpower.
