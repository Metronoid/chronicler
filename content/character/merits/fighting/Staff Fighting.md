# Staff Fighting (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Strength ••, Dexterity •••, Weaponry •• 

**Style Tags**: Pole Weapons 

**Effect**: Your character uses a staff as her weapon of choice. These maneuvers are usually performed with a quarterstaff or bo staff, but anything of a suitable length and shape like a walking stick or a heavy curtain rod will work as well. 

**Short Grip** (•): Your character moves her grip to the end of the staff, maximizing reach but losing speed. She gains a +1 to attack at the cost of her staff’s +1 bonus to Defense. You can change your character’s grip once per turn reflexively before taking an action. 

**Thwack Weapon** (••): Your character slaps away an opponent’s weapon with the tip of her staff. She can Disarm with a roll of Strength + Weaponry contested by an opponent’s Strength + Athletics. If successful, the opponent drops his weapon at his feet. On an exceptional success, your character knocks the weapon a number of meters (or yards) away equal to her successes rolled.

**Vaulting Defense** (•••): Your character knows how to use her staff to rapidly reposition herself in a fight. Spend a point of Willpower; your character can add her dots in Melee to her Defense against one attack per turn. 

**Tornado Strike** (••••): Your character spins her staff rapidly in a circle, hitting opponents all around her. She treats her staff attack as an autofire medium burst against up to three targets of her choice within range
