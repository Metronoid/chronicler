# Powered Projectile (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Firearms •• 

**Style Tags**: Pistol 

**Effect**: Your character is comfortable using premodern ranged weapons like crossbows, slingshots, and blowguns. Though long ago replaced by firearms, these weapons remain popular for hunting and are widely available in some countries. 

**Quick Reload** (•): Your character has trained herself on the steps to reload her weapon to the point it’s ingrained in her muscle memory. She reloads one turn faster than normal (to a minimum of a reflexive action). 

**Intercept Shot** (••): Your character can shoot a projectile out of the air with her own. This maneuver is not capable of stopping bullets, though it could be used to deflect a grenade if you’re feeling lucky. Any turn your character spends aiming she can make an attack against a thrown object with a –2 penalty (in addition to the normal penalties for attacking a small object). A successful hit deflects it a number of meters (or yards) equal to damage in a random direction. 

**Penetration** (•••): Your character knows how to best exploit the weaknesses in a target’s armor. She can add +2 to her weapon’s armor piercing rating for her next attack. 

**Drawback**: This shot requires intense concentration. Your character loses her Defense any turn she uses this maneuver. 

**Skewer** (••••): Your character uses her projectiles to impale parts of an opponent’s anatomy. When attacking a specified target, reduce the penalty by –2, and any inflicted Conditions require the victim to roll Stamina + Strength – damage inflicted to remove a projectile before it’s resolved.
