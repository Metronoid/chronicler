# Psychokinesis (••• or •••••)
**Effect**: Your character has a psychic ability to manipulate the forces of the universe. Every type of Psychokinetic is different. For example, your character might have Pyrokinesis, Cryokinesis, or Electrokinesis, the control of fire, cold, or electricity, respectively. This is not an exhaustive list. He can intensify, shape, and douse his particular area of ability. With the three-dot version, some of the given force must be present for him to manipulate. With the five-dot version, he can manifest it from nothingness.

Spend a point of Willpower to activate Psychokinesis, and roll Resolve + Occult. Each success allows a degree of manipulation; choose one of the following options below. If you intend to cause harm with the roll, subtract the victim’s Resolve from the Resolve + Occult roll. If characters should be harmed without a direct attack, for example, if they run through a patch of flame, the three-dot version of the Merit causes one lethal damage, and the five-dot version causes two. The Storyteller may rule that larger manifestations may cause more, if the situation calls for it. 

• Increase or decrease the Size of the manifestation by 1. 

• Move the manifestation a number of yards equal to your character’s Willpower dots times 2. 

• Shape the force into a specific form. This may require an Intelligence + Crafts roll to form it into a detailed or intricate shape. 

• Attack a victim with the force. Allocate any number of the rolled successes to cause harm. With the three-dot Merit, Psychokinesis is a weapon causing one lethal damage. Psychokinesis is considered a two lethal weapon with the five-dot version. 

• Use the force creatively. This is up to the situation and the force in question. For example, an Electrokinetic may use his ability to power an electronic device briefly or to jumpstart a stalled automobile. 

• Manifest his force. This only works with the five-dot version. It manifests a Size 1 patch of the force. It may spread or be enlarged with further successes.

**Drawback**: Whenever your character depletes his last Willpower point, the Storyteller can call on his abilities to manifest spontaneously. Resist this with a Resolve + Composure roll, with a -2 penalty if his chosen force is prominently featured nearby. For example, the penalty applies if a Pyrokinetic is locked in a factory with a hot forge. This tends to happen during wildly inconvenient moments, and in ways that usually cause more trouble than they solve. With these wild manifestations, use of Psychokinesis does not cost Willpower.
