# All-In (•••)

**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Supernatural (Lucky) •

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: Most competent characters can all but assure basic
success on skilled tasks. Your character can forgo that assurance, and turn an otherwise guaranteed victory into a gambit
between catastrophe and miracle. Spend a Willpower point
to activate All-In. Reduce your dice pool for a given action
to one die. Roll that single die, but with 8-again if you did
not already have it. If successful, the action succeeds. If the
roll fails, the roll is considered a dramatic failure.

For every two dice removed from your pool (rounded
down), a successful roll achieves one additional automatic
success. For example, if your character has eight dice, reducing
that to one die would offer three automatic successes (seven,
divided by two, rounded down), if your roll was successful.
If you rolled a single success, this would mean the action
succeeds with four successes.

No effect can apply the rote quality to this roll.
