# Evil Eye (••)
**Effect**: Your character can inflict paralysis on her enemies
with her baleful stare. As an attack, roll a contested Wits +
Occult versus the opponent’s Resolve + Composure. If successful, apply the Insensate Tilt to the victim for turns equal
to successes.

**Drawback**: Sacrifice your Defense any turn you use Evil
Eye. If an opponent has charms or other supernatural protection from curses apply a +3 bonus to his contested roll.
