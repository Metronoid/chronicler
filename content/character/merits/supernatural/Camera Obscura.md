# Camera Obscura (•••)
**Prerequisites**: Unseen Sense •• (Ghost) or (Spirit)

**Effect**: Your character is able to capture ephemeral entities
on camera, damaging them in the process. Doesn’t matter
whether it’s through the viewfinder of a high-end digital
camcorder or a grainy cell phone’s front facing camera, this
ability is tied to the soul of the character rather than any particular piece of technology. By spending a point of Willpower,
she can focus her camera on any un-Manifested entity she is
aware of and perceive it through the device as if it were visible. Every turn spent focusing, roll Wits + Expression – the
entity’s Defense; successes inflict bashing damage.

**Drawback**: Use of this ability immediately causes the
Open Condition on the surrounding area for any entity affected for the rest of the scene.
