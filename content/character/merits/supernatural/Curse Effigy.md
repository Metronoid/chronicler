# Curse Effigy (•••)
**Effect**: Whether by sticking pins in a wax doll or cutting
up photographs in her burn book, your character knows how
to create effigies that can hurt her enemies without physically
touching them. This process doesn’t require occult training.
It can be anything from a tradition passed down through
generations of family members to instructions downloaded
off the Internet: What matters is her focused hatred toward
her enemy.

To create an effigy, spend a point of Willpower and roll
Wits + Occult – the victim’s Resolve. The effigy requires
something personal from the intended victim (a sample of
hair or blood), and takes an entire night to craft. For every
success, you may inflict one of the following penalties on the
subject as an instant action:

• An appropriate Personal Tilt; Arm Wrack Tilt by stabbing the effigy’s arm, or the Sick Tilt by coating an
effigy in a hospital patient’s mucus. This effect lasts
for one turn per success used.

• Attacking vital organs with a roll of Intelligence
+ Medicine – subject’s Stamina + Supernatural
Tolerance, doing lethal damage.

• Whisper horrible things to the effigy, distracting the victim
and reducing the victim’s next Social action to a chance die.

Once all successes are used the effigy falls apart and any
new ones must be created with a fresh sample. If an effigy is
destroyed or the victim gains possession of his effigy, then
any remaining successes are wasted.
