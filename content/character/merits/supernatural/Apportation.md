# Apportation (••• or •••••)
**Effect**: Your character can rip objects through space from
one fixed point to another. The more familiar she is with an
object the greater the distance she can move it. No mundane
barrier can prevent this transference. With the three-dot
version, only inanimate objects Size 2 or less can be moved.
With the five-dot version she can move objects and living
creatures up to Size 5, including herself.

Spend a point of Willpower to activate Apportation and
roll Resolve + Occult. She can move an object a number of
yards equal to her successes. If she wishes to move the same
object further, she can spend multiple turns accumulating
successes to add to her total. Moving an unwilling target is
a contested action versus the target’s Resolve + Composure.

**Suggested Modifiers**: Target object is not in your character’s line of sight (–2), Target object is moving or a moving part of a machine (–3), Target object is anchored to its
location (–4), Your character interacts with the target object
regularly (+1), Your character has read the target object with
Psychometry in the past (+2), Your character has scanned a
living target with Telepathy in the past (+2)

**Drawback**: The process of apporting an object imparts
a great deal of friction on it, leaving it hot to the touch or
burned in the process. An item takes one point of Structure
damage each time it’s apported and has a –2 penalty to use for
the turn after it’s moved. Living creatures take bashing damage equal to the number of yards moved with Apportation.
