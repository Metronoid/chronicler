# Psychic Concealment (•••)
**Prerequisites**: Mind Control •••, Stealth •••

**Effect**: Your character can move unnoticed by the perceptions of others. This is not true invisibility; her victims
are still able to see and hear her. She has just altered their
minds not to register the sensory input of her presence. The
memories of her activities remain in a victim’s subconscious,
recoverable by hypnosis or other means. Note that cameras
and surveillance equipment aren’t affected by this ability.

To activate Psychic Concealment, spend a point of
Willpower and roll Wits + Stealth – the victim’s Composure.
If attempting to activate this ability against multiple targets,
use the highest Composure in the group and add a –1 penalty for every additional target (to a maximum –5). Success
inflicts the Oblivious Condition on all targets
in the psychic’s immediate area.
