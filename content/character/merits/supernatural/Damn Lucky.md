# Damn Lucky (• to •••••)

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: When taking damage from any source, spend a
point of Willpower reflexively to activate Damn Lucky. This
Merit “absorbs” up to one lethal damage or two bashing damage per dot, protecting your character from that harm. At any
point in the same scene, you may choose another character
to suffer that harm. The Storyteller decides just how this
manifests. The victim may potentially avoid the harm with a
successful Wits + Composure roll, requiring successes equal
to your dots in this Merit. If successful, she may act normally
(potentially requiring Initiative rolls) or apply her Defense. If
the Storyteller needs to make a dice roll for the phenomenon,
use twice your Merit dots, but do not apply the successes as
additional damage.

For example, if your character has Damn Lucky •••, and
takes a bullet to the chest for four lethal damage, you may
spend a point of Willpower to activate this Merit. The bullet
would only cause one lethal damage; the bullet may have hit
the book he’s keeping in his coat pocket. You may choose to
have that damage apply to his shooter. The Storyteller decides
that happens when a ricochet knocks down a chandelier.
The shooter’s player rolls Wits + Composure, and gets the
required three successes. So the Storyteller makes an attack
roll for the chandelier, but applies the shooter’s Defense to
the roll.

If the total damage absorbed is less than your Merit dots,
you may absorb damage from multiple sources, but only up
to a limit of your total dots in a scene.
