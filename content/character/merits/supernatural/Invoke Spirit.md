# Invoke Spirit (••)
**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Medium •••

**Effect**: Your character has experienced a trauma that a
spirit has latched onto, creating a symbiotic relationship with
her. Work with the Storyteller to determine the nature of the
trauma and the type of spirit it attracted, but should be only
as powerful as Rank 1. Your character can telepathically call
upon her spirit to protect her at any time.
Drawback: Your character has the Urged Condition for
the spirit as long as she has this Merit. The spirit will want
to push her towards circumstances that repeat the trauma
she experienced so that it can feed off the Essence released.
