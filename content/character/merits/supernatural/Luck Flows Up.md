# Luck Flows Up (••)

**Prerequisites**: Supernatutal (Lucky) •

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: Your character is a magnet for fortune and fate.
When she’s close to someone, she unintentionally steals his
good fortune. If she touches someone, this Merit takes effect
unless she spends a point of Willpower to curb the effect for
a scene. In the same day, any failures the subject makes are
considered dramatic failures. If she’s used this Merit at any
time in a given day, she gains four dice any time she spends
Willpower to increase a dice pool.

**Drawback**: Once a victim of this Merit suffers a dramatic
failure, he hears your character’s name in the back of his
mind. Luck has a sense of humor.

**Special**: Your character cannot have this Merit and Thief of
Fate.
