# Animal Possession (•• or ••••)
**Prerequisites**: Animal Ken •••

**Effect**: Your character is able to take over the senses of
her animal companion. This ability supplants the animal’s
mind so your character’s can take over. Her own body goes
into a coma-like state and she has no awareness of what it feels
or perceives while she is away. Spend a point of Willpower
and roll Resolve + Animal Ken. If successful, your character
is in control of her animal’s body for a scene and has its full
range of senses at her disposal. If at any point the animal
sustains damage, make a reflexive Resolve + Animal Ken
roll with a penalty equal to the amount of damage taken.
Failure immediately ejects her from the animal’s mind and
back into her own.

You may only use this Merit on an animal with which you
share the Bonded Condition. With the four-dot version, you
can ignore this limitation.
