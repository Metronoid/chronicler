# Phantasmagoria (••)
**Prerequisites**: Telepathy •••••, Expression ••

**Effect**: Your character can create illusions in the minds of
others. The victim experiences these visions as if he were dreaming, and to onlookers he seems like he’s sleepwalking or in a
trance. Spend a point of Willpower to activate Phantasmagoria
and roll Manipulation + Occult. The content of the illusion is
determined entirely by your character, but the more unbelievable the situation the more likely the victim is to see through it.
Make a new roll each turn you change the illusion significantly.

If at any point a victim starts to disbelieve what he’s
seeing, he can make a reflexive Resolve + Composure roll
to snap out of it. Your character cannot inflict damage on
a victim by hurting him in the illusion. However, the threat
of violence does cause a victim to snap back to his senses
suddenly and may impose the Spooked Condition at the
Storyteller’s discretion.

**Suggested Modifiers**: The changes made in the illusion are
very subtle (+1), the illusion takes place in the victim’s past (+2),
the illusion takes place in a setting unfamiliar to the victim (–1), the illusion contains elements that are obviously unrealistic or
go against the victim’s personal world view (–3)
