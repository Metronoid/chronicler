# Dark Passenger (••)

**Effect**: Your character has grown a second mouth on the
back of her head, beneath her hair, that whispers secrets to
her. Whenever she meets someone new or visits a new place,
you may ask three questions to the Storyteller or a character’s
player. The mouth answers two of them, but one of its answers
is a lie. The mouth also warns her of imminent danger; if she
fails the reflexive Wits + Composure roll to detect an ambush
she can immediately make a second roll at a –1 penalty.

**Drawback**: Aside from being unsettling to look at, the
mouth is constantly hungry. It needs food every hour or it’ll
begin crying loudly, imposing a –3 penalty to any actions that
require concentration.
