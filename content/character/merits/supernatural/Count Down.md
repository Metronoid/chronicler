# Count Down (•)

**Prerequisites**: Supernatural (Lucky) ••

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: No one ever sees the bullet with his name on it,
but a character with this Merit at least knows how many other
bullets are in the chamber. The character is acutely aware
of how many times he’ll narrowly escape death. This may
manifest as a number in his dreams, a mysterious tattoo he
doesn’t remember getting that changes each time he dies,
or Mr. Lucky showing up to hold up fingers whenever the
character wonders about it.

**Drawback**: Knowing how many times you can run into
a bad situation and live to tell about it has its own internal
pressure. Characters with this Merit suffer a Condition
related to how they cope with that stress. For example, a character actively paranoid about his own deaths may suffer
a permanent Paranoid Condition.
