# Bless Amulet (• to •••)
**Prerequisites**: Occult •••

**Effect**: Your character can create charms that protect
others from ephemeral possession. The ritual requires an
object with significance to the ritualist, religious or otherwise.
Spend a point of Willpower and roll Resolve + Composure,
modified by the ritualist’s Integrity as per an abjuration. Each success prevents the amulet’s wearer from having the Claimed or
Possessed Condition applied to her for one day. This effect
lasts a week with the two-dot version of this Merit, and at three
dots the object provides permanent protection to the wearer.
