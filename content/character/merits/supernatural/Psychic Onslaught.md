# Psychic Onslaught (•••••)
**Prerequisites**: Telekinesis • or Psychokinesis •••

**Effect**: Your character discharges psychic energy from
herself with the concussive force of a grenade: smashing windows, crushing bones, and bursting blood vessels. This is not
a precise weapon; it radiates out from the psychic annihilating
friend and foe alike. By spending a point of Willpower, this
triggers a Damage 3, Force 3 explosion with a primary blast
area of the psychic’s Resolve in meters or yards. The psychic
is at ground zero, but only suffers bashing damage – not
lethal. If the damage exceeds a character’s Stamina then it
applies the Knocked Down Tilt as well – this does not apply
to the psychic.

**Drawback**: This power is instinctive to your character’s
will to survive. The first time in a scene her last Health
box becomes filled with bashing or lethal damage, Psychic
Onslaught triggers as a reflexive action, without the normal
Willpower cost. This occurs even if the damage would render
her unconscious or kill her.
