# Consecrate Weapon (••••)
**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Occult ••••

**Effect**: Sometimes there just isn’t an opportunity to sit
down and research the multi-mouthed horror coming at you.
Your character knows rituals that make any weapon temporarily effective against ephemeral entities. Spend a point of
Willpower and roll Resolve + Composure – the weapon’s
damage rating. This ritual follows the same rules as abjurations for bonuses
from channeling the higher self and from a strong psyche. For
each success your character’s weapon does lethal damage to
Manifested ephemeral entities for one turn. It also does lethal
damage to entities in Twilight, provided she can detect them.
