# Nine Lives (• to •••••)
**Prerequisites**: Supernatural (Lucky) •

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: Any time your character might die (or should
die) in a scene, you can cash in one dot of this Merit. Fate
conspires to save you at the last minute. You’re moved up
to some stable state and removed from immediate danger.
You’ll pop up later okay — banged up, whatever, but alive.
Characters with this Merit do not necessarily know how many
lives they have left. Because of the nature of being lucky, it’s
very hard to tell if what they had was a brush with death or
just a brush with misfortune.

**Special**: Dots of Nine Lives can only be purchased at
character creation. When you cash in a dot of Nine Lives,
you can change it out with the Sanctity of Merits rule.
