# Incite Ecosystem (• to •••••)
**Prerequisites**: Animal Ken •••

**Effect**: Your character causes surrounding wildlife
to attack her enemies. Spend a point of Willpower and
roll Presence + Animal Ken. She can direct a number of
animals or swarms equal to successes, with Size up to dots
in Incite Ecosystem, to treat a target as a threat. Note that
animals directed this way do not take commands from
your character, they only respond to a target the way they
would a threat in their natural habitat. The effect lasts
for a scene. For larger animals take a penalty to your roll
equal to the difference in Size. For example, a bear (Size 7)
would require you to roll at a –2 with the five-dot version
of Incite Ecosystem.
