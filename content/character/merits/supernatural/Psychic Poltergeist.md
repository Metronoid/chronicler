# Psychic Poltergeist (••)
**Prerequisites**: Telekinesis •
**Effect**: Your character barrages enemies with objects from
her environment. By activating Telekinesis, she can cause
nearby Size 0 or 1 objects to converge on an area like a swarm.
The swarm envelops a number of victims equal to her dots
in Telekinesis. Each victim within the swarm’s area suffers
the persistent Distracted Condition (p. 150) until he or she
escapes. Additionally, the Storyteller determines an appropriate
amount and type of damage from being within the swarm. For
example, a cloud of whirling kitchen knives or burning chunks
of furniture would inflict lethal damage, while stuffed animals
would inflict bashing, if any. This should be limited to a dice
pool equal to the psychic’s Resolve. However, victims taking any action besides Dodging cannot apply their Defense against the
swarming objects.

**Drawback**: This ability requires the telekinetic’s complete
concentration. She must spend a point of Willpower every
turn and can take no other actions. She can apply Defense
to incoming attacks, but taking damage immediately ends
Psychic Poltergeist.
