# Sojourner (•••)
**Prerequisites**: Apportation •••

**Effect**: Your character’s mastery over her powers of
Apportation allows her to reach vastly greater distances. As
an extended action, she can move an object or person to any
fixed point with a target number equal to the number of
miles (or kilometers) transported. This negates the damage
normally caused by Apportation.
