# Psychokinetic Resistance (•)
**Prerequisites**: Psychokinesis •••

**Effect**: Your character has become so attuned with to her
source of psychokinetic energy that it no longer affects her.
A pyrokinetic could dance in the middle of a bonfire, or an
electrokinetic struck by lightning not so much as flinch. Use
her dots in Psychokinesis as general armor against any damage
taken from her source of energy.
