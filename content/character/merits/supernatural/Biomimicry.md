# Biomimicry (• to ••••)
**Prerequisites**: Biokinesis •

**Effect**: Your character’s body responds to threats by
evolving its own natural defenses. What other animals need
countless generations to develop she has in the time it takes
to scream — and she will. By spending a point of Willpower
and taking a point of lethal damage for each, you may divide
the dots in this Merit among the following benefits:

• Natural weapons (such as claws that grow out from
underneath the fingernails or a second row of jagged
teeth protruding from the gums) that do lethal damage, but treated as 0 lethal weapons.

• Biological toxin (venom sacs in the throat or mucus
secreted from the pores) that coats a target with a
Dexterity + Athletics roll; target’s Defense applies.
If successful, it inflicts a moderate version of the
Poisoned Tilt on the victim.

• Armor (tumorous growths covering the skin, thick
leathery hide, fused bone plates covering vital organs,
etc.) with a rating of 2/1, but a –2 penalty to Initiative.

• Camouflage (skin that can change pigment and texture
to match the environment) granting the 8-again quality
to all Stealth rolls.

These changes last for a scene, but your character can
force them back with a successful Stamina + Resolve roll,
penalized by the number of mutations taken. Otherwise,
her mutations are visible to the naked eye and obviously
inhuman. She can still use mundane means to hide them,
like heavy layers of clothes.
