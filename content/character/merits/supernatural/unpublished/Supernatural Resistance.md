# Supernatural Resistance (• to •••••, Supernatural Merit)
**Prerequisites**: Mortal with at least one Supernatural Merit

**Effect**: Your character’s brush with the supernatural left
her with an inborn tolerance for the unknown. This Merit
acts as a Supernatural Potency trait for the purpose of resisting
supernatural powers. So if a power calls for Blood Potency,
Primal Urge, Gnosis, or other traits, use her Merit dots.
