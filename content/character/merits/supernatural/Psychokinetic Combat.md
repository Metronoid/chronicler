# Psychokinetic Combat (Style; • to •••••)
**Prerequisites**: Psychokinesis ••• or •••••

**Effect**: Your character has honed her psychic abilities into
a dangerous weapon. All the conditions required to activate
your character’s Psychokinesis must be present to use any of
the following maneuvers. Any attacks subtract the victim’s
Resolve from the pool, as normal. Each of these abilities
requires that your character activate Psychokinesis, or have
Psychokinesis already active, but does not incur further cost
unless otherwise noted.

**Corona** (•): You surround yourself with a field of energy,
affecting anyone who comes too close. Any close combat
attacks made against you automatically inflict one point of
lethal damage on the attacker; with the five-dot version of
Psychokinesis this is increased to two points. If engaged in
a grapple, this damage is inflicted every turn. The field lasts
for a number of turns equal to successes rolled to activate
Psychokinesis.

**Mind Over Matter** (••): When you focus your energy on
weak points, even the most well-protected enemy is at risk.
Your Psychokinesis attacks now gain armor piercing 2 and
are not affected by cover.

**Trapped Potential** (•••): You can turn even the most
innocuous items into time bombs of psychic energy. When
you activate Psychokinesis, choose any Size 0-3 object within
yards equal to your character’s Resolve. As a reflexive action,
you can detonate the object causing three points of bashing
damage to anyone close by it and creating a Size 3 patch of
force. With the three-dot version this object must have the
ability to produce your chosen force on its own, such as a
lighter or welding torch for a pyrokinetic, but with the fivedot version any object can be trapped this way.

**Imbue Weapon** (••••): By channeling psychic energy
through yourself you can make your weapons more effective.
When rolling to manifest Psychokinesis, you may choose to
accept lethal damage up to your character’s successes, up to
your character’s final Health box. Each point of damage taken
adds one weapon damage to the next attack your character
makes. With the three-dot version of Psychokinesis, your
character must have a nearby source of energy to draw from
to use this maneuver.

**Harvest Psyche** (•••••): You’ve learned to collect the
psychic feedback of others’ minds to fuel your own abilities.
Each time your character causes damage with Psychokinesis,
gain one Willpower.
