# Automatic Writing (••) 
Your character can enter a trance of sorts, in which she’s temporarily overtaken by a spirit or ghost, and compelled to write mysterious things. 

**Effect**: Your character must meditate for at least one minute. Spend a point of Willpower and roll Wits + Composure to enter the trance. For every success, your character writes a single statement or clue about something occurring in the area or relating to a pertinent issue. The Storyteller provides these clues, and they may at first seem completely nonsensical. Characters may attempt to interpret the clues with Wits + Investigation or research efforts.

**Drawback**: If the roll fails, or the character does not employ a personal item of a local spirit in the meditation, she’s haunted afterward. Any time she fails a roll for the next week, it’s considered dramatic as the spirit intervenes in complicating and sometimes dangerous ways.
