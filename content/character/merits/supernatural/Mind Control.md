# Mind Control (•••)
**Effect**: Your character can guide another’s train of thought
through her own force of will. All her commands must be
spoken aloud unless she has an ability to communicate telepathically. The subject is unaware of the manipulation as
it’s happening, but later may remember he acted strangely.

Spend a point of Willpower to activate Mind Control and
roll Manipulation + Persuasion, minus the victim’s Resolve.
If successful, you apply the Fixated Condition tied to a simple, one-sentence command.
