# Assertive Implement (• to ••••)
**Prerequisites**: Manipulation •••, Occult •••, Weaponry or Firearms ••

**Effect**: Your character has a weapon with a mind of its
own. It could be haunted by a vengeful ghost or possessed
by a spirit of violence. When she’s using it, the entity inside
makes her weapon more effective, so long as its own needs
are being fulfilled. Once per scene she can add her dots in
Assertive Implement to an attack roll. She can choose to add a +1 bonus to her weapon’s damage for every two dots
of Assertive Implement, instead. The weapon is also more
resilient than an ordinary tool; it regenerates a point of
Structure every night even if it’s been “destroyed.” If, however,
the entity itself is removed through exorcism or other means,
then the object is destroyed automatically.

**Drawback**: The weapon is not a servant, it’s a partner.
If the Storyteller determines that an action goes against the
entity’s whims, he can inflict a reflexive penalty equal to
dots in Assertive Implement. Also, if the weapon has an
opportunity to fulfill its needs and your character hesitates,
then the weapon can attack on its own using your dots in
Assertive Implement as its dice pool.
