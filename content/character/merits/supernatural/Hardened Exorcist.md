# Hardened Exorcist (•)
**Effect**: Your character stood her ground against intruders
from other realms, and despite the toll it’s taken on her soul
she remains defiant. Add her Occult dots to her Integrity for
determining any bonuses to abjuration rolls. You can also
use your exorcist’s Vice to call upon abjurations without the
usual penalty.
