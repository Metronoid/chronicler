# Omen Sensitivity (•••) 
**Effect**: Your character sees signs and patterns in everything. From the way the leaves fall, to the spray of antifreeze when his radiator pops, to the ratios of circumference on the shell he picked up on the sidewalk, everything has meaning. With some consideration, he can interpret these meanings. This would be far better if he could turn it off. Everything is important. Everything could mean the end of the world, the deaths of his friends, or other tragedies. If he misses an omen, it might be the wrong one. 

Once per game session, you can make a Wits + Occult roll for your character to interpret an omen in his surroundings. For every success, ask the Storyteller a yes or no question about your character’s life, his surroundings, a task at hand, or the world at large. The Storyteller must answer these questions truthfully. 

**Drawback**: His ability becomes an obsession. Each time he reads a portent, he gains the Obsession or Spooked Condition.
