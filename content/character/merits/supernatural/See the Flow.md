# See the Flow (• to •••••)

**Prerequisites**: Supernatural (Lucky) •

**Style Tags**: Supernatural (Lucky)

**Effect**: The character with this Merit have an innate sense
of people who are about to experience the flow of fortune,
for better or worse. Further, they can declare with startling
accuracy when someone is about to pull off something
incredible or when they’re about to fail hard. Their predictive capability has nothing to do with seeing the future, and
everything to do with following luck’s flow.

When the player of another character or the Storyteller
prepares a dice pool to roll, if it is more than eight dice, the
character gets a sense of luck flowing positively for that character. In the same situation, should a dice pool be three or
under, the character gets a sense of a rush of bad luck flowing
toward that person. Further, if a character has a modified
threshold of exceptional success on a roll they are about to
perform (as is the case with Merits like Professional Training),
the character gets a secondary sense that the chances of something amazing are much higher.

At that point, the character can spend a point of Willpower.
If she does, she can reduce or increase the perceived dice pool
by a number up to her See the Flow dots. She may use this
Merit to affect multiple dice pools in a scene, but only up to
her total dots. This isn’t the character affecting luck, but more
that she’s calling out the exceptional fate in the moment. So,
for example, a mage able to detect shifts in luck would not
detect a change from this Merit.
