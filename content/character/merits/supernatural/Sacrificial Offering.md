# Sacrificial Offering (• to •••••)
**Prerequisites**: Occult •••, Mystery Cult Initiation •••••

**Effect**: Your character performs a ritual to give her power
at the cost of a victim’s soul. This ritual must be tied directly
to the beliefs of her Mystery Cult. Make an extended Wits
+ Occult roll, with each roll representing 10 minutes of
chanting and preparation. Her victim must be immobilized
for the duration of the ritual. The total number of successes
determines the benefit given to your character. This benefit
lasts for days equal to her dots in Sacrificial Offering.

• 5 successes — A four-dot Merit, or four dots worth of
Merits blocked on a target

• 7 successes — Five dots of Supernatural Merits

• 10 successes — Direct intervention by an ephemeral
being aligned with her cult

**Suggested Modifiers**: The victim possesses a trait with
significance to the cult’s beliefs (+1), character is aided by
other members of her cult in performing the ritual (+2),
victim is a supernatural being (–2), victim is already injured
(–2), victim has Integrity 4 or below (–3)

**Drawback**: Every use of this ritual provides diminishing
returns. Each time it’s used, the number of successes required
increases by one, cumulatively. This ritual is always considered a breaking point for those who participate.
