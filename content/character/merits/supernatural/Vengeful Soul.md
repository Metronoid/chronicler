# Vengeful Soul (••)
**Effect**: Your character is carrying the burden of a loved one’s
death, and his soul cries out for justice within her. Your character
must have witnessed the death or come upon it no later than
24 hours after it occurred, and made (though not necessarily
succeeded at) a breaking point roll associated with the death. She
can add the 8-again quality to a number of rolls every chapter
equal to the victim’s Integrity at his time of death. These rolls
must involve finding or punishing those responsible. You lose
this Merit when the death is avenged to the satisfaction of the
victim’s spirit (not when your character decides the job is done).
