# Hidden Variable (••)
**Prerequisites**: Unseen Sense •• (God-Machine)

**Effect**: Your character is a disruptive force to the
God-Machine’s subsystems. She sees the weak points in
Infrastructure. This ability could be innate to her or embedded by the God-Machine’s own agents. She gains a +1 bonus
to attack rolls when near Infrastructure, and ignores two
points of Durability against any object with the Infrastructure
Condition. When dealing with mortal Infrastructure ignore
two dots of general armor instead.
