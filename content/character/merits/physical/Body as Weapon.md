# Body as Weapon (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Stamina •••, Brawl •• 

**Effect**: Your character has honed her body to be a hardened weapon. She has trained long, punishing hours to inure herself to the pain of the cracked knuckles, broken hands, and crushed toes that come with hitting others with her body. She can hit harder and more often without flinching. Your character’s unarmed strikes still cause bashing damage normally, but they add one point of bashing damage on a successful hit.
