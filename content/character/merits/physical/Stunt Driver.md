# Stunt Driver (• to ••••; Style)
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity •••, Drive •••, Wits •••

**Effect**: Your character is an expert behind the wheel, and
can push a vehicle beyond normal limits. Each dot of this
Merit grants access to another driving technique.

**Defensive Driving** (•): Your character knows how to protect
herself and her vehicle while driving. Subtract her Drive
dots from any attempt to hit her vehicle while it’s mobile.

**Speed Demon** (••): Your character is an expert at pushing
vehicles to their potential in no time flat. Each success
on rolls to accelerate a vehicle (see p.98) raises the vehicle’s
Speed by 10 instead of 5.

**Drift** (•••): Your character knows how to use her vehicle’s
momentum to efficiently turn at high speeds. She never needs
to make a maneuvering roll to turn at high speeds.

**Clipping** (••••): Your character has experience hitting
things with her vehicle in such a way as to not hurt herself
much. When voluntarily hitting another character or vehicle
with hers, ignore damage to her own vehicle equal to her
Wits. This is applied before Durability.
