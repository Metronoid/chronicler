# Crack Driver (•• or •••)
**Prerequisite**: Drive •••

**Effect**: Your character’s an ace at the wheel, and nothing
shakes his concentration. So long as he’s not taking any actions
other than driving (and keeping the car safe), add his Composure
to any rolls to Drive. Any rolls to disable his vehicle suffer a penalty
equal to his Composure as well. With the three-dot version,
once per turn he may take a Drive action reflexively.
