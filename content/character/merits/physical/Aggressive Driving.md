# Aggressive Driving (Style; • to ••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Resolve •••, Fast Reflexes •••, Drive ••• 

**Style Tags**: Tactical (Police) or (Street) 

**Effect**: Any vehicle can become a weapon when your character is behind the wheel. From the earliest days of bootleggers these maneuvers have passed between police and criminals as a means to evade or stop other vehicles, even at high speeds. 

**Powerslide** (•): Your character can slide into turns and gain momentum coming out. Make a reflexive Dexterity + Drive + Handling roll anytime your character’s vehicle comes to a curve, successes add to her total for that turn in a contested pursuit. This causes one point of Structure damage to the vehicle

**Bump and Run** (••): Your character brings her vehicle alongside an opponent’s and swipes his bumper, causing his rear tires to lose traction. First developed in stock car racing, this technique is used by police departments around the world as a safe means of ending a pursuit. Roll Dexterity + Drive + Handling minus an aware opponent’s Defense. If successful, an opponent must succeed on an immediate Dexterity + Drive roll or lose control of his vehicle. 

**J-turn** (•••): Your character can turn her vehicle around so quickly she baffles pursuers. If, during a contested pursuit, an opponent achieves more successes and catches up to her she can spend a point of Willpower and roll Dexterity + Drive + Handling with a –2 penalty. Success allows her to restart the chase, but now going in the opposite direction. This maneuver can only work successfully once per scene. 

**Swoop and Squat** (••••): Your character cuts off an opponent’s vehicle and jams her brakes, forcing an opponent to stop or wreck. A favorite of insurance fraudsters, this technique is most effective with another car beside the target vehicle to pin it in. Anytime she gains more successes than victim’s Wits in a contested pursuit, the victim must make a reflexive Resolve + Composure + Handling to stop his vehicle or else he crashes into the other vehicle’s rear. Note that a victim can choose to crash instead of stop.
