# Air of Menace (••) 
**Prerequisites**: Intimidation •• 

**Effect**: Your character has survived dozens of fights, and each one has taken its toll. He carries scars, features that have healed crookedly, and an attitude that unsettles others. The character gains +2 dice to rolls that use fear and menace to force compliance, such as with Intimidation rolls. Opponents less menacing than the character also think twice before provoking him. Opponents with Intimidation dots fewer than the character’s must spend a point of Willpower to initiate combat against him. 

**Drawback**: Though many people try to overcome their prejudices, appearance still drives many human opinions. In social maneuvers, the character’s first impression is downgraded one step for people who do not know him, and even for those who do, he must overcome an additional Door.
