# Double Jointed (••)
**Prerequisite**: Dexterity •••

**Effect**: Your character might have been a contortionist,
or spent time practicing yoga. She can dislodge joints when
need be. She automatically escapes from any mundane bonds
without a roll. When grappled, subtract her Dexterity from
any rolls to overpower her, as long as she’s not taking any
aggressive actions.
