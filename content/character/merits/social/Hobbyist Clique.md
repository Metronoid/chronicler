# Hobbyist Clique (••) 
**Prerequisite**: Membership in a clique. All members must possess this Merit, and the chosen Skill at ••+ 

**Effect**: Your character is part of a group of hobbyists that specialize in one area, represented by a Skill. It may be a book club, a coven, a political party, or any group brought together by a common interest. When the group’s support is available, you benefit from the 9-again quality on rolls involving the group’s chosen Skill. As well, the clique offers two additional dice on any extended actions involving that Skill. 

**Drawback**: This Merit requires upkeep. You must attend at least monthly, informal meetings to maintain the benefits of Hobbyist Clique.
