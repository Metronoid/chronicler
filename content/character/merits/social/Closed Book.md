# Closed Book (• to •••••) 
**Prerequisites**: Manipulation •••, Resolve ••• 

**Effect**: Your character is particularly tough to crack. When a character uses Social Maneuvering against her, add her dots in this Merit as additional Doors. In other Social actions to uncover her true feelings, motives, and position, add her Merit dots to any contested rolls for her. 

At the Storyteller’s discretion, this can apply to supernatural effects used against her. For example, it might allow her to resist a power that forces her to speak the truth, since she can manipulate the wording. However, it wouldn’t affect someone looking at her aura, since she cannot manipulate her spiritual resonance.
