# Barfly (••)
**Prerequisite**: Socialize •• 

**Effect**: Your character is a natural in the bar environment, and can procure an open invitation wherever he wishes. Whereas most characters would require rolls to blend into social functions they don’t belong in, he doesn’t; he belongs. Rolls to identify him as an outsider suffer his Socialize as a penalty.
