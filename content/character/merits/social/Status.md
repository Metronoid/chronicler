# Status (• to •••••) 
**Effect**: Your character has standing, membership, authority, control over, or respect from a group or organization. This can reflect official standing, or merely informal respect. No matter the source, your character enjoys certain privileges within that structure. 

Each instance of this Merit reflects standing in a different group or organization. Your character may have Status (The Luck Gang) •••, Status (Drag Racing Circuit) ••, and Status (Police) •. Each affords its own unique benefits. As you increase dot ratings, your character rises in prominence in the relevant group. 

Status only allows advantages within the confines of the group reflected in the Merit. Status \(Organized Crime) won’t help if your character wants an official concealed carry firearms permit, for example Status provides a number of advantages: 

Your character can apply her Status to any Social roll with those over whom she has authority or sway.

She has access to group facilities, resources, and funding. Depending on the group, this could be limited by red tape and requisitioning processes. It’s also dependent on the resources the particular group has available

She has pull. If she knows a character’s Mentor, Resources, Retainer, Contacts, or Allies, she can block their usage. Once per chapter, she can stop a single Merit from being used, if it’s of a lower dot rating than her Status, and if it makes sense for her organization to obstruct that type of person’s behavior. In our Police example, if your character knows a local reporter has Contacts (Police Insider), they may opt to block usage by threatening to reveal the insider if they continue to talk.

**Drawback**: Status requires upkeep, and often regular duties. If these duties are not upheld, the Status may be lost. The dots will not be accessible until the character re-establishes her standing. In our Organized Crime example, your character may be expected to pay protection money, offer tribute to a higher authority, or undertake felonious activities.

## Hunters
Hunters can purchase the Status Merit to reflect their organization at each of the three tiers. With a single dot of a conspiracy’s Status, the hunter gains access to the conspiracy’s Endowments.

Hunters may have Status in only a single conspiracy, but may belong to a conspiracy and a compact, or multiple compacts.

**Drawback**: Additionally, hunters who dive deep into their conspiracies find it difficult to care or concern themselves with lesser issues. A hunter’s Status in non-conspiracy or -compact organizations is capped at 6 minus her dots in a compact or conspiracy Status. If she has Ascending Ones Status 4, the maximum rating her Police Status (or any other Status) can be is 2. If increasing her compact or conspiracy Status makes her lose Status in other organizations, the Merit is subject to the Sanctity of Merits.
