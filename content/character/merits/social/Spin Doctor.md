# Spin Doctor (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Manipulation •••, Subterfuge •• 

**Effect**: Your character can fast-talk and sell bullshit stories as if they were completely flawless. When suffering from Tainted Clues, your character does not ignore successes. Instead, apply a -1 penalty for each relevant Tainted Clue. Using a Tainted Clue only levies a total -2 penalty with this Merit, which includes the -1 taken in lieu of ignoring successes.
