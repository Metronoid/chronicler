# Object Fetishism (• to •••••) 
**Effect**: Your character places immense trust and confidence in an object, often assuming it has mystical or otherworldly significance. He believes he’s tied inexorably to the object. Choose a Skill Specialty when taking this Merit; that Specialty must be tied to your character’s relationship to the object. 

Each chapter, your character gains an additional number of Willpower points equal to the Merit’s dots. If your character uses Willpower on a roll using that Specialty, any failure is considered a dramatic failure. However, exceptional successes occur on three successes instead of five. 

Your character cannot regain or use Willpower when separated from the object. 

**Note**: If the fetish object is destroyed or truly lost, it constitutes a breaking point, the dice pool of which suffers this Merit’s dots as a penalty.
