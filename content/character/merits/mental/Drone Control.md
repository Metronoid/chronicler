# Drone Control (Style; • to •••) 
**Prerequisites**: Intelligence •••, Computer •••, Drive •• 

**Style Tags**: Tactical (Military) or (Police)

**Effect**: Your character knows how to operate weapon systems via remote. Though more impersonal than a knife or a gun, armed drones are quickly becoming a mainstay of the modern battlefield and increasingly sophisticated in the consumer market. These maneuvers work independently of the sophistication of the actual device. An RC car with a mounted pistol and a Wi-Fi receiver works just as well as a state-of-the-art military drone for the purposes of using this Style. 

**Remote Immersion** (•): When your character accesses her drone she enters a focused state that lets her perceive and react to things as if she were physically present. Perception rolls made using the drone gain the 9-again quality. 

**Interface** (••): Your character has honed her control over her drones to the level of instinct. Spend a point of Willpower; she can take an additional instant action per turn with her drone. Drones capable of attacking can only make one attacking action per turn. 

**Overclock** (•••): Your character can push her drone past the boundaries of its hardware. By sacrificing a point of Structure, she can add +2 to Physical actions the drone makes that turn.
