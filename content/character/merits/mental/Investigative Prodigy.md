# Investigative Prodigy (• to •••••)
**Prerequisites**: Wits •••, Investigation •••

**Effect**: Your character investigates instinctively, and can
intuit details and connections in a scene without much time.
He’s a veritable Sherlock Holmes. Instead of simply uncovering
Clues or not uncovering Clues when investigating, your character discovers multiple Clues in a single action.
Your character can uncover Clues equal to his successes or his
Merit dots as an instant action, whichever is lower.
Only the first Clue benefits from additional elements;
other Clues established with this Merit receive only a single
element each.
