# Multilingual (â€¢)
**Effect**: Your character has a strong affinity for language
acquisition. Each time you purchase this Merit, choose two
languages. Your character can speak conversationally in those
languages. With an Intelligence + Academics roll, he may also
read enough of the language to understand context.
If you purchase the Language Merit for either of these
languages, replace the Multilingual language. For example,
if you have Multilingual (French, Italian), and purchase
Language: Italian, you may choose to take Multilingual
(French, Portuguese).
