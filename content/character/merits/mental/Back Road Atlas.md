# Back Road Atlas (•) 
**Prerequisites**: Wits •• and Drive •• or Athletics •• 

**Effect**: Your character has a knack for memorizing local back roads, shortcuts, detours, and other routes that don’t pop up on a digital map or GPS system. All rolls that require you to travel discreetly to escape an antagonist’s notice receive a +2 bonus. Additionally, your character has the Edge in a chase scene provided you’re not on highways or main streets. Back Road Atlas most often applies to vehicular travel but can just as easily apply to foot or bike chases as well. However, there must be a visible road or path for you to follow. 

**Drawback**: This Merit does not apply to trackless wilderness. It applies to any area in which the character has travelled; to employ this Merit for unfamiliar streets, the character must make a successful Intelligence + Wits or Drive roll after reviewing a physical or digital map to commit the routes to memory.
