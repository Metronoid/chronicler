# Professional Training (• to •••••)
**Effect**: Your character has extensive training in a particular
profession, which offers distinct advantages in a handful
of fields. When choosing this Merit, choose or create a
Profession for your character (see the sidebar). Mark the
two Asset Skills on your character sheet. The advantages of
Professional Training relate directly to those Asset Skills when applicable.

• Networking: At the first level of Professional
Training, your character builds connections within
her chosen field. Take two dots of Contacts relating
to that field.

•• Continuing Education: With the repeated efforts
in her field of choice, your character tends toward
greater successes. When making a roll with her
Asset Skills, she benefits from the 9-again quality.

••• Breadth of Knowledge: Due to her advancement
in her field, she’s picked up a number of particular
bits of information and skill unique to her work.
Choose a third Asset Skill, and take two Specialties
in your character’s Asset Skills.

•••• On the Job Training: With the resources at her
disposal, your character has access to extensive
educational tools and mentorship. Take a Skill
dot in an Asset Skill. Whenever you purchase a
new Asset Skill dot, take a Beat.

••••• The Routine: With such extensive experience in
her field, her Asset Skills have been honed to a fine
edge, and she’s almost guaranteed at least a marginal
success. Before rolling, spend a Willpower point to
apply the rote action quality to an Asset Skill. This
allows you to reroll all the failed dice on the first roll.

**Special**: The term profession is deliberately defined loosely. So long as it has Skills that are employed regularly and a community of similarly dedicated individuals that can be consulted for advice and tradecraft, any field may potentially qualify for this Merit.
