# Punch Drunk (••) 
**Prerequisite**: Willpower ••••••+ 

**Effect**: Your character’s resolve is unwavering, even when suffering wounds, broken limbs, and lost blood. She can fight on past the point that her body demands she quit. When she suffers bashing or lethal damage that would remove her last Health box, you may spend a point of Willpower to keep the last box, and instead upgrade damage in her other Health boxes. This Merit has no effect on aggravated damage.
