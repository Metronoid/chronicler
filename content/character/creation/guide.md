# **Character Creation: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Creating a character involves developing their concept, personality, and abilities through a series of steps.

## **Step 1: Developing an Exciting Character Concept**

Creating a memorable and unique character starts with developing a solid character concept. This can be done by combining two distinct concepts that interest you. For example, instead of just being a "medical nurse", you could be a "medical nurse who is also a skilled hacker". This added layer of complexity will make your character more interesting and give you more to work with when creating and playing the character.

When coming up with your character concept, it's important to remember that the concept should reflect the modern, current day setting. Think about real-life descriptors such as jobs, hobbies, skills, and personality traits that you find intriguing. Then, combine two of these concepts to form a unique character idea.

For example, you could combine the concept of "teacher" with "amateur detective" to create a character who is a high school history teacher by day and solves small-town mysteries in their free time. Or, you could combine the concept of "firefighter" with "aspiring chef" to create a character who saves lives and creates delicious meals.

By combining two distinct concepts, you'll have a foundation to build your character upon, making it easier to flesh out the details and bring your character to life in the game world.

## **Step 2: Defining Your Character's Aspirations**
Defining your character's aspirations is an important step in bringing your character to life. These aspirations give your character a sense of purpose and direction, and provide motivation for their actions.

To create your character's aspirations, start by coming up with two short-term goals and one long-term goal. These goals should align with your character's unique concept and reflect the challenges and opportunities available.

For your short-term goals, think about what your character wants to achieve in the immediate future. These goals should be achievable within a few in-game sessions and provide a sense of accomplishment and progress for your character. For example, if your character is a skilled hacker, their short-term goal could be to track down and expose a corrupt corporation, while another short-term goal could be to retrieve valuable information for a client.

Your long-term goal should be more challenging and require significant effort and progress over a longer period of time. This goal should reflect what your character wants to achieve in the distant future. For example, if your character is a firefighter and aspiring chef, their long-term goal could be to open a restaurant that specializes in fire-roasted cuisine, combining their two passions.

Consider your character's strengths, weaknesses, and personality traits when creating their aspirations. This will help to make their goals feel natural and in-line with their character concept.

Keep in mind that your character's aspirations can be changed at any time. You can add, replace or remove any aspirations you want. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of your character's motivations and what drives them forward. This step is completely optional if you want it to be. Aspirations are meant as a tool to enhance your playing experience, not a source of stress.

## **Step 3: Identifying Your Character's Virtues and Vices**
In this step, you'll delve deeper into your character's personality and flesh out their strengths and weaknesses by identifying their virtues and vices. These character traits are an important aspect of creating a well-rounded and compelling character.

A virtue is something that your character is proud of, a characteristic that they admire about themselves. It could be a positive trait, such as honesty, bravery, or empathy, or a skill or talent they possess, such as leadership or artistic ability. When thinking about your character's virtues, consider what makes them unique and sets them apart from others. For example, a firefighter who also happens to be a chef may be proud of their bravery and quick thinking under pressure, as well as their culinary skills that bring comfort to others. A medical student who is also a hacker may admire their intelligence and problem-solving skills, as well as their compassion for helping others.

A vice, on the other hand, is a characteristic that your character or their environment dislikes about them, but that they could not live without. Vices often serve as a coping mechanism for dealing with life's challenges. For example, the firefighter/chef may have a vice of excessive drinking to numb the stress of their job, or a tendency to be overprotective of loved ones. The medical student/hacker may have a tendency to neglect their own self-care while trying to help others, or a vice of being overly confident in their abilities and sometimes taking unnecessary risks.

It's important to note that your character does not need to be perfect. In fact, it can be more interesting if your character is broken in some way. Allowing them to have vices and flaws can make the story more dramatic and realistic. Ensure everyone is comfortable your choices and try to avoid duplicates.

When coming up with your character's virtues and vices, consider how they align with their aspirations and personality. This will help to make the character feel well-rounded and cohesive. Additionally, consider how these traits may come into play during the game and impact your character's decisions and actions.

## **Step 4: Assigning Attributes**
In this step, you'll further develop your character by assigning attribute dots to represent their Physical, Mental, and Social Attributes. These dots help quantify your character's abilities and give insight into their strengths and weaknesses.

You have a total of 5 dots to spend among your primary attributes, 4 dots among your secondary attributes, and 3 dots among your tertiary attributes. Consider what is most important to your character and what they excel at, then allocate the dots accordingly.

The Mental Attributes include Intelligence, Wits, and Resolve. Intelligence measures a character's academic knowledge, Wits represents their quick thinking and perception, and Resolve reflects their determination and focus.

The Physical Attributes include Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina. Strength measures a character's muscle power, Dexterity represents their hand-eye coordination, and Stamina reflects their physical fitness.

The Social Attributes include Presence, Manipulation, and Composure. Presence is a measure of a character's charisma and leadership, Manipulation represents their ability to influence others, and Composure reflects their emotional control and resistance to manipulation.

Each attribute is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 dot representing below average ability, 2 dots indicating average ability, 3 dots showing above average ability, 4 dots denoting exceptional ability, and 5 dots representing the pinnacle of human potential for that particular attribute. Every attribute starts a 1 dot for free.

For example, if your character is a firefighter/aspiring chef, you might choose Physical Attributes as your primary, Mental Attributes as your secondary, and Social Attributes as your tertiary. This reflects the quick thinking and problem-solving needed in their job, as well as the physical demands. In this case, you would allocate 5 dots to Physical Attributes, 4 dots to Mental Attributes, and 3 dots to Social Attributes. For example, a firefighter/aspiring chef might spend 2 dots in Resolve and 1 dot each in Intelligence and Wits, reflecting their determination and focus under pressure. They might also spend 2 dots in Strength and Stamina and 1 dot in Dexterity, reflecting the physical demands of their job, and 2 dots in Composure and 1 dot in Presence, reflecting their emotional control and ability to stay calm under pressure.

Alternatively, if your character is a medical student/hacker, you might choose Mental Attributes as your primary, Social Attributes as your secondary, and Physical Attributes as your tertiary. This reflects the intelligence and communication skills needed for their job and personality. In this case, you would allocate 5 dots to Mental Attributes, 4 dots to Social Attributes, and 3 dots to Physical Attributes. For example, a medical student/hacker might spend 3 dots in Intelligence and 2 dots in Wits, reflecting their academic knowledge and quick thinking skills. They might also spend 2 dots in Dexterity and 1 dot in Stamina, reflecting their hand-eye coordination and precision in their skills. Additionally, they might spend 2 dots each in Presence and Manipulation, reflecting their charisma and ability to influence others.

By assigning attribute dots and choosing a primary, secondary, and tertiary attribute, you'll give your character a clear sense of their abilities and strengths, making them more dynamic and exciting to play. Consider your character's concept, aspirations, and personality traits when making these choices.

## **Step 5: Assigning [Skills](/character/skills)**
In this step, you'll further define your character by assigning skill dots to represent their areas of expertise. Skills represent a character's ability to perform various tasks and actions within the game world.

You get to spend a total of 11 dots among your primary skills, 7 dots among your secondary skills, and 4 dots among your tertiary skills. Some skills are general and cover a wide range of abilities, while others are more specific and focused. Consider what your character is good at and what they enjoy doing, then allocate the dots accordingly. It's important to note that the choice for primary, secondary, and tertiary skills doesn't have to be the same as for your Attributes. Each skill is rated on a scale of 0 to 5 and doesn't have a free dot in each skill like Attributes. For a full list on skills check [this page](/character/skills)

If your character does not have any dots assigned to a skill, they can still attempt to use it, but with a penalty of -1 for Physical/Social skills and -3 for Mental skills.

For example, if your character is a firefighter/aspiring chef, you might allocate skill dots in areas such as Athletics, Firearms, and Survival to reflect their physical abilities and training, as well as Crafts to reflect their passion for creating. If your character is a medical student/hacker, you might allocate skill dots in areas such as Medicine, Science, and Technology to reflect their academic knowledge and expertise, as well as Empathy and Persuasion to reflect their communication skills and compassion.

Consider your character's Attributes and Aspirations when making skill choices. For example, if your character has a high Intelligence, you might want to allocate more dots to skills such as Science or Technology that would benefit from their knowledge. If your character has a long-term goal of starting a business, you might allocate more dots to Crafts to reflect their creative aspirations.

## **Step 6: Adding Skill Specialties**
In this step, you'll further refine your character's skills by adding specialties. A specialty is a particular area of expertise within a skill, and helps to make your character feel more unique and specialized.

You get to choose a total of three specialties among your skills to reflect your character's unique focus and areas of expertise. Having a specialty in a skill gives your character a bonus die when performing tasks related to that specialty. For example, if your character has a Firearms skill and a specialty in Shotguns, they would receive a bonus die when using shotguns in the game. Keep in mind that one skill can have multiple specialties.

When choosing specialties, think about what makes your character unique and sets them apart from others. Consider your character's background, personality, and aspirations when making these choices. For example, if your character is a firefighter/aspiring chef, you might choose specialties in Firefighting Techniques, Cooking Techniques, and First Aid, reflecting their expertise in all three areas. If your character is a medical student/hacker, you might choose specialties in Medical Procedures, Computer Hacking, and Surveillance, reflecting their areas of expertise.

## **Step 7: [Merits](/character/merits)**
In this step, you'll further define your character by assigning Merits. Merits are unique traits that go beyond your character's attributes and skills, representing things like advantages, resources, and unique abilities.

Each character starts with seven dots for Merits. When choosing Merits, think about what makes your character special and sets them apart from others. Merits can represent a wide range of things, such as having a strong network of contacts, owning a valuable resource, or having a unique ability.

For example, a firefighter/aspiring chef might choose the Merit "Iron Stomach," representing their ability to eat just about anything and not get sick. Another example for this character might be the Merit "Fearless," reflecting their bravery and lack of fear in dangerous situations.

On the other hand, a medical student/hacker might choose the Merit "Eidetic Memory," reflecting their exceptional ability to remember information, or the Merit "Safehouse," representing a secret hideout or secure location.

When choosing Merits, consider your character's background, personality, and aspirations. Allocating Merits should enhance the overall playing experience.

## **Step 8: Completing the Character Sheet and Assigning Advantages**
In this final step, you'll complete your character sheet by calculating the values for several key advantages: Willpower, Integrity, Size, Speed, and Health.

**Willpower** is the sum of Resolve and Composure, representing inner strength and determination.\
**Integrity** is set at 7, reflecting a character's moral compass and personal code.\
**Size** is 5 for adult human characters, representing physical stature and bulk.\
**Speed** is the sum of Strength, Dexterity, and 5, reflecting quickness.\
**Health** is the sum of Size and Stamina, reflecting overall physical well-being.

Take some time to review your character sheet and make any final tweaks or changes. When you're satisfied, it's time to start playing and exploring the world with your new creation.
