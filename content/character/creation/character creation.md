# **Character Creation: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Creating a character involves developing their concept, personality, and abilities through a series of steps.

## **Step 1: Developing an Exciting Character Concept**

Creating a memorable and unique character starts with developing a solid character concept. This can be done by combining two distinct concepts that interest you. For example, instead of just being a "medical nurse", you could be a "medical nurse who is also a skilled hacker". This added layer of complexity will make your character more interesting and give you more to work with when creating and playing the character.

When coming up with your character concept, it's important to remember that the concept should reflect the modern, current day setting. Think about real-life descriptors such as jobs, hobbies, skills, and personality traits that you find intriguing. Then, combine two of these concepts to form a unique character idea.

For example, you could combine the concept of "teacher" with "amateur detective" to create a character who is a high school history teacher by day and solves small-town mysteries in their free time. Or, you could combine the concept of "firefighter" with "aspiring chef" to create a character who saves lives and creates delicious meals.

By combining two distinct concepts, you'll have a foundation to build your character upon, making it easier to flesh out the details and bring your character to life in the game world.

## **Step 2: Defining Your Character's Aspirations**
Defining your character's aspirations is an important step in bringing your character to life. These aspirations give your character a sense of purpose and direction, and provide motivation for their actions.

To create your character's aspirations, start by coming up with two short-term goals and one long-term goal. These goals should align with your character's unique concept and reflect the challenges and opportunities available.

For your short-term goals, think about what your character wants to achieve in the immediate future. These goals should be achievable within a few in-game sessions and provide a sense of accomplishment and progress for your character. For example, if your character is a skilled hacker, their short-term goal could be to track down and expose a corrupt corporation, while another short-term goal could be to retrieve valuable information for a client.

Your long-term goal should be more challenging and require significant effort and progress over a longer period of time. This goal should reflect what your character wants to achieve in the distant future. For example, if your character is a firefighter and aspiring chef, their long-term goal could be to open a restaurant that specializes in fire-roasted cuisine, combining their two passions.

Consider your character's strengths, weaknesses, and personality traits when creating their aspirations. This will help to make their goals feel natural and in-line with their character concept.

Keep in mind that your character's aspirations can be changed at any time. You can add, replace or remove any aspirations you want. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of your character's motivations and what drives them forward. This step is completely optional if you want it to be. Aspirations are meant as a tool to enhance your playing experience, not a source of stress.

In summary, by defining two short-term goals and one long-term goal for your character, you'll give them a clear sense of purpose and motivation, making them more dynamic and exciting to play.

## **Step 3: Identifying Your Character's Virtues and Vices**
In this step, you'll delve deeper into your character's personality and flesh out their strengths and weaknesses by identifying their virtues and vices. These character traits are an important aspect of creating a well-rounded and compelling character.

A virtue is something that your character is proud of, a characteristic that they admire about themselves. It could be a positive trait, such as honesty, bravery, or empathy, or a skill or talent they possess, such as leadership or artistic ability. When thinking about your character's virtues, consider what makes them unique and sets them apart from others. For example, a firefighter who also happens to be a chef may be proud of their bravery and quick thinking under pressure, as well as their culinary skills that bring comfort to others. A medical student who is also a hacker may admire their intelligence and problem-solving skills, as well as their compassion for helping others.

A vice, on the other hand, is a characteristic that your character or their environment dislikes about them, but that they could not live without. Vices often serve as a coping mechanism for dealing with life's challenges. For example, the firefighter/chef may have a vice of excessive drinking to numb the stress of their job, or a tendency to be overprotective of loved ones. The medical student/hacker may have a tendency to neglect their own self-care while trying to help others, or a vice of being overly confident in their abilities and sometimes taking unnecessary risks.

It's important to note that your character does not need to be perfect. In fact, it can be more interesting if your character is broken in some way. Allowing them to have vices and flaws can make the story more dramatic and realistic. Ensure everyone is comfortable your choices and try to avoid duplicates.

When coming up with your character's virtues and vices, consider how they align with their aspirations and personality. This will help to make the character feel well-rounded and cohesive. Additionally, consider how these traits may come into play during the game and impact your character's decisions and actions.

In summary, by identifying your character's virtues and vices, you'll add depth and complexity to their personality, making them more compelling and exciting to play.

## **Step 4: Assigning [Attributes](/character/attributes)**
Determine capabilities with mental, physical, and social attributes rated 1-5. Start with 1 dot per attribute and choose your primary, secondary, and tertiary attributes based on your character concept.

You allocate 5 dots to the primary Attribute that is most relevant to the character concept and reflects the character's key ability. For example, if your character concept is "med student," Mental might be the primary Attribute.

You allocate 4 dots to the secondary Attribute, which is still important to the character concept but not as much as the primary Attribute. For the "med student" example, Social might be the secondary Attribute.

You allocate 3 dots to the tertiary Attribute, which is the least important to the character concept but still relevant. For the "med student" example, Strength might be the tertiary Attribute.

## **Step 5: [Skills](/character/skills)**
Divide skills into mental, physical, and social categories, rated 0-5. Allocate 11 dots to primary, 7 to secondary, and 4 to tertiary categories.

## **Step 6: Skill Specialties**
Choose three specialties within a skill to reflect a character's unique focus.

## **Step 7: [Merits](/character/merits)**
Add unique traits beyond attributes and skills with seven dots for merits.

## **Step 8: Advantages**
Calculate the values for advantages such as 

*Willpower* (Resolve + Composure)\
*Integrity* (7)\
*Size* (5 for adult human unless modified)\
*Speed* (Strength + Dexterity + 5)\
*Health* (Size + Stamina).
