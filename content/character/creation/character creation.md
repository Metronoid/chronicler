# Character Creation

The system for creating a character is a simple, step-by-step process to take
an initial idea for a character, and flesh her out with goals, personality, and the
game traits that determine what she is capable of. It’s helpful to take a look at the
character sheet from the back of the book. You can fill out the sheet as you go
through the steps of creating your character.

## Step One: Character Concept

The first step in creating a character is to develop a general idea of who your character is. The Chronicles of Darkness, on the surface, is a world much like ours. Your starting character concept can easily be someone you could
meet on the street. Try to boil this down to a simple phrase,
like “bored medical student,” “single parent trying to get by,”
or “blogger obsessed with unsolved mysteries.” It doesn’t need
to be particularly complex, just a good starting point.

In addition to your concept, also consider your character’s Aspirations. These are goals that your character wants
to accomplish, or stories and events that you, as the player,
want to see happen during your character’s story. Thinking
about your Aspirations early on, as part of your character
concept, helps to make sure that your character is active, and
that there are story hooks to get your character involved immediately. You can also use Aspirations as a way to connect
player characters, by giving them similar goals. We’ll talk more
about Aspirations in their own section, later in this chapter.

## Step Two: Anchors

Once you have a general idea and some goals for you
character, you can define a bit more of his personality. You
do this by selecting Anchors. Anchors are those things that
help a character retain his sense of self and drive his behavior.
For a mortal character in the Chronicles of Darkness, his
Anchors are his Virtue and his Vice.

For each of your character’s Anchors, decide on a description of a major personality trait or motivation for your
character: something like Ambition, Honesty, Kindness, or
Greed. For your character’s Virtue, you’ll want to pick a trait
that is difficult to act on or easy to ignore, but that makes the character feel proud when he does make the effort. His Vice,
on the other hand, is the trait that represents the easy way
out, the things that bring the character short-term comfort,
but never seem to drive him to actually improve.

## Step Three: Select Attributes
Now you set your character’s basic capabilities. Attributes
are fundamental traits, defining how strong a character is,
how well she can keep her temper when provoked, or how
quickly she can improvise a solution to a problem.

A character starts with one dot in each Attribute for
free. One dot represents someone who is below average in
that capability, while two dots represent someone average. A
character with three or four dots is above average or extremely
talented, while five dots represents the peak of human ability.

Attributes are divided into the Mental, Physical, and
Social categories. For your character, consider which of the
categories is most important. What sort of endeavors does
your character excel at? Once you have picked a primary category, decide out of the remaining two which is your character’s next-best category. You’ll assign five dots to the Attributes
in your primary category, four dots to the Attributes in your
secondary category, and three dots to the Attributes in your
tertiary category.

It’s worth taking a moment to consider the Attributes and
how they connect to your character concept. While picking categories is often easy (an Olympic Athlete probably has
Physical as her primary category), sometimes picking a less
obvious category can make for a more interesting character. 

## Step Four: Select Skills

Like Attributes, Skills are divided up into the Mental,
Physical, and Social categories. However, unlike Attributes,
you do not get a free dot in Skills.

Skills represent applications of your abilities. These are
things you have learned from training, books, or teachers.
Having no dots in a Skill means that you have no training with
it, and are barely capable. One dot means you have cursory
training or dabble in the Skill, while two dots means that you
can use the Skill at a professional level. Three dots represents
excellent training or experience, four is outstanding, and five
dots means you are one of the absolute best in the world.

Like Attributes, select a primary, secondary, and tertiary
category for your Skills. You have eleven dots to assign for
your primary category, seven dots for you secondary, and four
dots for your tertiary. As always, consider your character and
concept when assigning dots. Maybe your blogger has two dots
in Athletics because he is a marathoner, or your med student
has a dot in Animal Ken from volunteering at a local shelter.

## Step Five: Pick Skill Specialties
Skills represent broad categories of training. Someone
with the Science Skill is equally familiar with particle physics, basic chemistry, and genetics. Skill Specialties allow you
to differentiate more, focusing on a specific area of a Skill
that your character is more knowledgeable or proficient in.

A character’s Specialties say a lot about her. For example,
a character with a Socialize Specialty in Formal Events is very
different from one with a Specialty in Dive Bars.

Pick three Skill Specialties for your character. The Skill
descriptions will have some suggested Specialties.

## Step Six: Merits
Merits are important facets of your character that do not
fall under other traits. A Merit can represent a knack, special
training, people your character knows, or even things that he
owns. They add unique capabilities to your character beyond Attributes and Skills.

You have seven dots you can use to pick Merits.

## Step Seven: Determine Advantages
The final step in character creation is calculating Advantages.
Use the following rules to determine the values for these traits.

### Willpower
A character’s Willpower score is equal to Resolve +
Composure.
### Integrity
All mortal characters start with an Integrity of 7.
### Size
All adult human characters are Size 5, unless modified
by a Merit.
### Speed
A character’s speed is equal to Strength + Dexterity + 5.
A character can move this many meters in one turn.
### Health
A character’s Health is Size + Stamina.
