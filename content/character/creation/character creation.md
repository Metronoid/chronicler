# **Character Creation**
Creating a character is a step-by-step process, it involves developing an initial idea with goals, personality, and traits to determine their capabilities.

## **Step One: Character Concept**
Start with a simple, real-world basic idea. Add character's Aspirations for goals/events to provide story hooks and immediate involvement.

**Examples:** "bored medical student", "single parent" or "mystery blogger"

## **Step Two: Anchors**

Define character's personality with Anchors (Virtue and Vice). Choose challenging/admirable traits for Virtue, comforting/damaging for Vice (e.g. Ambition, Honesty, Kindness, Greed). Consider character's behavior and sense of self.

*Integrity* = 7\
*Size* = 5 (for adult human) unless modified\
*Speed* = Strength + Dexterity + 5 (meters per turn)\
*Health* = Size + Stamina
