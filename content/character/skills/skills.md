# **Skills: Your learned abilities**

Skills are learned abilities and are divided into Mental, Physical, and Social categories. Each skill can have a specialty which allows for customization and grants a +1 bonus to rolls. Without any dots in a skill, characters can still attempt to use it but with a penalty of -1 for Physical/Social skills and -3 for Mental skills. 

Mental skills represent knowledge, while Physical skills involve force, endurance and coordination, and Social skills include charm, poise, and personality. The pairing of skills with attributes can vary and the attribute used may not always match the category of the skill.
