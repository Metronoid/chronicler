# Skills

Skills are learned and practiced abilities, rather than the innate
abilities that Attributes represent. Skills reflect a character’s origins
and interests, and can be acquired in many ways, from institutionalized learning to hands-on experience. Skills are divided into the
same Mental, Physical, and Social categories as Attributes.

## Skill Specialties
Skills are very broad abilities, representing whole fields of
knowledge or training. A Skill Specialty is a more focused application of a Skill, representing a specific subcategory of the
Skill that the character is particularly talented or trained in.

Skill Specialties allow you to personalize your character
more. Two characters with very similar Skills can feel very
different in play, if they have different Specialties.

If your character has an applicable Specialty when you
are rolling a Skill, you gain a +1 modifier, allowing you to
roll an additional die.

## Untrained Skills
A character who has no dots in a Skill can generally still
attempt to use it. However, there is a penalty due to the
character’s complete unfamiliarity with the Skill. For Physical
and Social Skills, this penalty is -1. For Mental Skills, this
penalty is -3.

## Mental Skills
Mental Skills generally represent knowledge, book
learning, and understanding of facts or procedure. They
cover things like remembering a fact, searching for a clue,
or diagnosing an illness. Mental Skills are often gained
through formal training, and a character may have certificates, degrees, or doctorates in her area of study. However,
the rating in the Skill does not necessarily map to a certain
level of education.

Mental Skills are commonly paired with Mental
Attributes. However, they are sometimes used with Physical
or Social Attributes. For example, repairing the wiring in a
broken CB radio requires a Dexterity + Crafts roll.

## Physical Skills
Physical Skills are those Skills that represent the application of force, endurance, or coordination. They are generally
learned through practice and personal experience, rather
than extensive schooling.

While these Skills are usually paired with Physical
Attributes, they can be rolled with other Attributes as well.
Casing a building, for example, uses Wits + Larceny

## Social Skills
Social Skills involve the application of a character’s charm,
poise, and personality. They generally don’t represent formal
training so much as a combination of innate talent and experience interacting with others. Social Skills are sometimes
paired with Physical or Mental Attributes, such as when you
roll Strength + Intimidation for a show of force.
