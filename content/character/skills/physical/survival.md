# Survival

Survival represents a character’s experience and ability
to “live off the land.” He knows how to find shelter, gather
food, and endure harsh elements and environments. He can
use the Survival Skill to find clean drinking water or hunt
animals for food, build simple structures, and build a fire.
The Survival Skill is not limited to wilderness or rural locales.
It can also be used to survive in an urban environment when
you have no other way of getting food or shelter.

The Survival Skill does not cover dealing with animals
beyond hunting. The character can track an animal, but
without the Animal Ken Skill, doesn’t understand much
about the animal’s behavior. He wouldn’t have much luck
trying to calm a bear that found its way into his campsite.

for a small group of people in the wilderness,
keeping them fed, healthy, and safe until they

civilization.

rank could live off the land indefinitely. She
may not be particularly comfortable, but she
can take care of necessities.

dropped into the
middle of the desert with no equipment and walk out. He

harshest environments on earth.
