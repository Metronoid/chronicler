# **Larceny**
Larceny covers the generally-illegal skills of breaking and
entering, lock picking, pickpocketing, safecracking, and
similar activities. There usually aren’t schools for this sort of
thing. Larceny is learned “on the job,” one way or another.

In addition to criminal applications, Larceny is used
by magicians and illusionists for sleight of hand. Most
locksmiths will also have at least a little bit of knowledge of
Larceny, as they understand how to open locks.

This Skill includes most of the tasks involving actually
defeating physical security, or the sleight of hand required
to pick a pocket or palm an item. It does not cover sneaking
around, hacking and digital crimes, or the social aspects of
running a con or distracting a mark.
