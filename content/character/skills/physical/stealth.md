# Stealth
Stealth is a character’s ability to stay hidden, unseen, and
unheard. It covers sneaking around in the shadows, blending
into a crowd, using a disguise to appear as just another bystander in the background, or taking advantage of an appropriately
timed distraction. Any means a character uses to avoid being
noticed by those who are looking for her will use this Skill.
