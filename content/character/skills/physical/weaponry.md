# Weaponry

Weaponry is the ability to fight with
hand-to-hand weapons. A character with
this Skill can wield knives, swords, baseball
bats, or even things like a length of chain or
a chainsaw. If you are using a tool (other than a
gun or bow) to do violence to someone, Weaponry
is the appropriate Skill to use.

While guns are generally more dangerous, there are
definitely times when you do not have access to one. You
can almost always find something that you can use as a
hand weapon, even if it’s just something like a screwdriver
or a broom handle.
