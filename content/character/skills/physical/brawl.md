# **Brawl**

The Brawl Skill is the fine art of hurting another person
with no weapons other than the character’s own body. It
can represent martial arts training, bar fight experience, or
simply a bad temper and a willingness to hurt others. It covers
throwing punches and kicks, but also things like grappling,
throws, head butts, and blocking in hand-to-hand combat.
Brawl is generally rolled with Strength in a hand-to-hand fight.

A character who is well trained in a specific style of combat
may have that represented with a Fighting Style Merit.
