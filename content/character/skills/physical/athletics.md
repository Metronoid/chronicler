# Athletics
Athletics broadly covers a number of different areas of
physical ability. It represents training in specific sports, from
kayaking or parkour to professional sports like basketball or
football. It can be used with any general application of physical power and coordination, such as running a marathon,
jumping between buildings, climbing a fence, or dodging
threats. It also determines a character’s ability with thrown
weapons in a fight, and adds to Defense to determine if
the character is hit in a fight. Just about any Chronicles of
Darkness character is likely to find some use for the Athletics
Skill. Sometimes, the only reasonable response is to run away.
