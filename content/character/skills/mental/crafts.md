# **Crafts**

The Crafts Skill represents a character’s knowledge of
repairing, designing, and creating things. It covers tasks like
rebuilding a car engine, laying a foundation for a house, or
sewing clothing. It also has some overlap with Expression
for purposes of creating paintings or sculpture. In general,
Crafts should be used when you are trying to make something that is accurate (a scale model, an eye-witness sketch,
or a reconstruction of a damaged manuscript) or useful for
a specific task, as opposed to something that is being created
to be beautiful or convey emotion.

A character using the Crafts Skill will generally need
specific tools and materials. They have the knowledge to
make something, but they usually cannot do it with their
bare hands. However, this generally should not cause them
problems unless they are in a situation where the tools or
materials are rare or difficult to access.
