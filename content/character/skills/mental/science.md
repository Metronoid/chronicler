# Science
Science is a character’s understanding of the natural
and physical sciences. It includes subjects like biology,
physics, chemistry, geology, and meteorology. Science
is useful for understanding how the world works. It
also helps characters make excellent use of resources
and helps with the design of and theory behind many
items that can be made using Crafts. A character with
a high Science Skill can explain what chemicals and
proportions are needed to make an explosive, or determine the best materials for making a cage to hold a
strange creature.
