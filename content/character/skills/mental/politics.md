# Politics

Politics represents a character’s knowledge of political
bodies, figures, and issues. It helps a character to navigate
bureaucracies and play the political game to get what he
wants. He knows how to follow the money and how to play rivals off each other. A character with this knowledge
may have run for office, worked for the government, or
may simply be a follower of local politics.

them). He could be an insightful amateur
blogger, or simply an exceptionally tuned in
voter.

how to work within the system, and understands the official organizational structure
very well. Low-level bureaucrats and lobbyists
generally have this level of the Politics Skill.

what they really want, and where the bodies
are buried.
