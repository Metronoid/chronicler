# **Investigation**

Investigation is a character’s ability to find and put together clues and solve mysteries and puzzles. It represents
the ability to think laterally and make useful intuitive leaps,
find meaningful patterns in confusion, and draw conclusions
from the available data.

Using this Skill is different than the Perception Attribute
task that can be found under Wits and Composure.
Perception is typically checked when a character is not actively searching, but could potentially see something out of place
or unusual. Investigation is a Skill that the character actively
uses to find clues and information and create a more concrete
picture of the situation.
