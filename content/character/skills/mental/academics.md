# Academics
Academics represents general higher education and
knowledge of arts and humanities. It covers topics like history, language, literature, law, and economics. It is a very
broad Skill that covers general knowledge in all of these
areas, but Skill Specialties can be used to represent a specific
focus. The Academics Skill often represents the amount
of schooling a character has. However, some characters
are self-taught or have learned a great deal about relevant
topics without actually setting foot on a college campus.
Also, some people with advanced degrees pay no attention
to topics outside their area of expertise, and have a low
rating in Academics.
