# Occult
The Occult Skill is a character’s knowledge of myth,
folktales, and urban legends about the strange things that
exist in the dark corners of the world. Occult can help a
character separate fiction and myth from fact and determine
which stories are likely to be actual supernatural events and
which are just rumors. That said, there are a lot of strange
things out there, and many of them defy easy categorization. The Occult Skill doesn’t necessarily give a character
a line on the absolute “truth” about what’s going on, but
instead represents an array of knowledge about encounters
and theories that others have had, and the ability to build
on those theories herself.
