# Computer

Almost everyone in the modern day can turn on a
computer, use the internet, and perform basic searches.
This Skill represents a character’s ability beyond that level.
Having the Computer Skill allows the character to develop
programs, diagnose and repair major software and hardware
problems, and perform more carefully focused and effective
searches for data. It can also be used for things like digging
into a file system, finding hidden or encrypted files, cracking
encryption, hacking into computer systems, or sabotaging
computer networks.

**Sample actions**: Hack into a computer system (Intelligence
+ Computer), Internet and database searches (Wits +
Computer), Programming (Intelligence + Computer)

**Sample Specialties**: Data Retrieval, Digital Security,
Hacking, Programming, User Interface Design

**Sample contacts**: AI Researcher, Hardcore Computer
Gamer, White Hat Hacker

## Levels:
• **Novice**: A character at this level has probably
used computers more extensively than the average
person. She has a basic grasp of programming, can
handle complicated searches, and can find and
interpret files that were hidden or encrypted by
the average (unskilled) user.

•• **Professional**: The character could be an entry level
programmer or IT professional. The character has
a solid grasp of programming principles and can
perform more elaborate computer tasks easily. She
can hack relatively unsecure networks and personal
computers.

••• **Experienced**: The character has excellent training
and talent, or has been working with computers
for a while. A character at this level is extremely
adept at finding the information she needs, even
when someone skilled has taken steps to hide it.
As a hacker, she can break her way into the files
of companies that have solid security.

•••• **Expert**: An expert in computer theory. The character can find extremely obscure information by
correlating data from many sources, and can track
down just about any irregularity in a computer’s
files. If she is a hacker, then she has the knowledge
and patience to get into government and even
military systems.

••••• **Master**: A character at this level is one of the best
in the world. She has worked with the absolute
cutting edge in computer technology, and can
break into pretty much any computer system in
the world. No information is safe from her.
