# Subterfuge
Subterfuge is the fine art of deception. With Subterfuge,
a character can lie convincingly, recognize when she is being
lied to, or convey hidden meaning in what she says. She can
hide her own motivations and emotions. Generally, this Skill
is used to trick others, but some characters learn it in order
to avoid being tricked themselves.
