# Socialize

The Socialize Skill is the art of small talk, polite gestures,
and fitting in. It represents your ability to interact with people
in a variety of social settings, from dive bars to state dinners. It
covers dealing with groups of people and behaving with the right
balance of sensitivity, friendliness, etiquette, and dignity for the
setting. A character with a high Socialize is the life of the party, or
at least able to meet almost anyone she wishes who is at an event.

**Sample actions**: Carouse (Manipulation + Socialize), Fit
in (Wits + Socialize), Get attention (Presence + Socialize)

**Sample Specialties**: Bar hopping, College parties, Formal
events, Political fundraisers, Private clubs

**Sample contacts**: Diplomat, Drinking Buddy, Society Matron

## Levels:

• **Novice**: A character at this level knows which
fork to use (or when not to use one), can avoid
insulting anyone, and can handle social situations
from formal dinners to wild parties.

•• **Professional**: At this level of Socialize, the character can
gracefully blend into just about any social situation.

••• **Experienced**: The character is invited to all of the
parties and makes sure everyone has a good time.

•••• **Expert**: The character can fit in anywhere. It’s not
considered a party unless she is in attendance, and
she can make any group of people feel at ease.

••••• **Master**: A character with this level of Skill could
be a spy or a high ranking diplomat. She always
seems to know exactly what is expected for the
social situation, including those times when acting
outside the norm is the best way to fit in.
