# Socialize

The Socialize Skill is the art of small talk, polite gestures,
and fitting in. It represents your ability to interact with people
in a variety of social settings, from dive bars to state dinners. It
covers dealing with groups of people and behaving with the right
balance of sensitivity, friendliness, etiquette, and dignity for the
setting. A character with a high Socialize is the life of the party, or
at least able to meet almost anyone she wishes who is at an event.

seems to know exactly what is expected for the
social situation, including those times when acting
outside the norm is the best way to fit in.
