# **Intimidation**

Intimidation is the art of using fear to convince others to
do what you want. A character can use this Skill for threats,
interrogation, subtle implications, or even a direct show of
force. It can convince characters to back down from a confrontation, reveal information they don’t want to share, or
get them to cooperate against their better judgement. It can’t
change their minds, but it can certainly change their behavior.
