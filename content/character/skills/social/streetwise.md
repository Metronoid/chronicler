# Streetwise

A character with the Streetwise Skill understands how
life on the streets works, and is adept at surviving and thriving by its rules. He can navigate the city, knows who to go
to for information or help, and knows where he will be safe.
Streetwise characters can make use of the city’s unique resources, buy and sell on the black market, or find out secrets.
It’s an important Skill for any character that needs to avoid
the law, navigate the dangers in the city, and keep from ending up on the bad sides of the wrong people.
