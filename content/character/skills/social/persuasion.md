# Persuasion
Persuasion is about using influence, charm, and careful
arguments to change minds and influence behavior. It can
involve logic and reason, glib fast talking, or appealing to
emotions or baser instincts. Unlike Intimidation, Persuasion
doesn’t just involve forcing a character to change how they
act, Persuasion is about changing their mind and how they
want to act.
