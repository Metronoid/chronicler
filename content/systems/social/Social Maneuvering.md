# **Social Maneuvering**
Social maneuvering is a way of using persuasion and social pressure to influence others over time. It can involve direct or subtle actions, and its goal is to convince characters to perform favors or take certain actions. However, it's not always possible to get someone to do what you want, even with a good dice pool. The system raises questions about the extent to which one character can dictate another's actions in a role-playing game, or even seduce them. According to the rules, seduction is possible as long as the goal is clear and factors such as impressions and doors are taken into account.

## **Goals** 

When using social actions with this system, declare the intended goal. Simply state what you want the subject to do and how you plan to make it happen. The storyteller decides if the goal is reasonable. For example, you may be able to convince a wealthy person to give you money, but not to abandon all their wealth to you. However, you might be able to get them to name you as their heir.

## **Doors** 

The next step after declaring the goal is to determine the challenge scope with "Doors." These represent a character's resistance to coercion or mistrust, and can change based on the situation. The base number of Doors is equal to the lower of the character's Resolve or Composure. Add two Doors if the goal is a breaking point, one Door if it prevents resolution of an Aspiration, and another if it goes against a Virtue. Doors may increase as the situation changes. To open a Door, make a successful roll, with exceptional successes opening two. Doors are a one-way relationship between two characters and can be different for each character.

## **First Impressions**

First Impressions determine the time between rolls. The Storyteller sets the first impression based on past history, meeting circumstances, the nature of the request, and other relevant factors. Average impressions call for weekly rolls. Good impressions can be influenced by creating a comfortable situation and require a roll. Excellent impressions require a roll to influence the situation, while perfect impressions require additional factors, such as leverage or playing to a character's Vice. Hostile impressions from tense meetings or threatening pitches require manipulation or forcing Doors.

### **Using Vices**

If a character knows the subject's Vice, they can influence the interaction by tempting the Vice. This moves the interaction up one step on the chart. Temptation is valid if the target character gains Willpower by agreeing to it.

### **Soft Leverage (Gifts and Bribes)**

"Soft Leverage" refers to using gifts or bribes to ease social interactions. When a character offers a bribe or service, if the recipient agrees, it improves their impression by one level. These bribes can be represented by specific Merit dots, like Resources 3 for a bribe or Retainer 3 for a service. The recipient can use the Merit for a designated period.

## **Opening Doors**

At intervals, rolls can be made to progress towards the goal. The type of roll can vary and may not always be social. For example, fixing someone's computer (Intelligence + Computer) can help gain their favor. As the storyteller, switch up the dice pools to keep interactions dynamic. Rolls can also be contested or resisted, but don't limit yourself to just Resolve or Composure. Other traits, like Wits, Strength, or Presence, can also be used.

Failed rolls incur a -1 penalty, cumulatively, and don't go away after successful rolls. The storyteller may worsen the impression level, causing the player to take a Beat, if it drops to hostile. Improvement is needed before the attempt can move forward.

### **Aspirations**

Knowing a character's goals, wants, and needs can help advance interactions. If your character offers a clear plan to help achieve a goal, remove one Door. This requires confidence, but not necessarily follow-through. If your character backs out of an offer, two Doors close.

### **Failure**

A social maneuvering attempt can fail if the player rolls a dramatic failure on an attempt to open a Door, resulting in the player taking a Beat. It can also fail if the target realizes they are being lied to or manipulated and feels betrayed or conned. Lastly, if the impression level reaches hostile and remains so for a week of game time, the character must try again during the next story.

## **Resolution**

When the final Door is opened, the subject must act. If it's a Storyteller character, they will follow through as intended. If it's a player character, the outcome is resolved through negotiation with the option to follow the intended goal or offer a better alternative.

If the character does as requested, and abides by the intended goal, his player takes a Beat.

## **Forcing Doors**

Your character can attempt to force another character's Doors when waiting and subtlety aren't feasible. This is a high-risk, high-reward situation that may lead to burnt bridges and missed opportunities. State your character's goal and approach, roll the dice, and apply the number of Doors as a penalty. The subject contests the roll and if successful, proceed to resolution. If the roll fails, the subject is immune to further social maneuvering attempts.

### **Hard Leverage**

Hard Leverage, such as threats or kidnapping, drives home the urgency needed to force open a character's Doors. If the character suffers a breaking point, it removes one or two Doors based on the roll modifier (-2 or greater removes one Door, -3 or less removes two Doors).

## **Influencing Groups**

Influencing a group uses the same system as influencing an individual, requiring an excellent impression or forcing the Doors unless the group meets regularly. The Storyteller determines the Doors using the highest Resolve and Composure scores and three Aspirations, a Virtue, Vice, and relative Integrity score for the group. Most members will abide by the stated goal, although individual members may depart. A clear majority will do as the player suggests.

## **Successive Efforts**

Once all Doors are opened and the goal is resolved, your character may attempt to influence the same person or group again. Successful attempts start with one fewer Door, while failed attempts or the use of hard leverage result in two more Doors. These modifiers accumulate and a character will always have at least one Door at the start.
