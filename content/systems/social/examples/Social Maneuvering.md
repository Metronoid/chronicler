# Example of Social Maneuvering 

Stacy wants Professor Erikson to loan her a book from
his private library. She intends to use the book’s contents to
summon a demon, but Erickson doesn’t know that. Erickson
is protective of his books, but he’d be willing to loan one out
under the right circumstances. Erickson has Resolve 3 and
Composure 4, so the base number of Doors Stacy needs to
open is 3 (the lower of the two). Loaning a book wouldn’t be
a breaking point, nor does it prevent him from achieving an
Aspiration, but it does work against his Virtue (Cautious),
so the total number of Doors Stacy needs to open to get the
book is 4. 

The Storyteller decides that the first impression is average; the two know one another (Stacy is a former student
of Erickson’s), but they aren’t close. Stacy arranges to find
Erickson at a conference and impresses him with her knowledge of esoteric funerary rites. This requires an Intelligence
+ Occult roll, plus whatever effort Stacy had to put forth to
get into the conference, but changes the impression level to
“good.” Now, Stacy can make one attempt to open Doors
per day. At the conference, Stacy’s player rolls Manipulation
+ Persuasion and succeeds; one Door opens. Stacy mentions
the book to Erickson and lets him know she’d like to borrow
it. He’s not immediately receptive to the idea, but Stacy’s in
a good place to continue.

The next day, Stacy emails the professor about a related
work (Manipulation + Academics), but fails. Future rolls will
have a -1 penalty. The Storyteller decides that the impression
level slips to average. 

Stacy still has to overcome three Doors. She spends the
next week doing research into Erickson and discovers that
he wants to become a respected academic. She tells Erickson
that she has a colleague who can help break the cipher in
which the book is written. This removes one Door without
a roll. Now she must overcome two more before he’ll agree.
(Note that even if Stacy has no intention of helping Erickson
in his quest toward academic glory, as long as he reasonably
believes that lending her the book will help him achieve his
Aspiration, it opens the Door.)

During her research into the professor’s personality, she
also learns that his Vice is Vanity; he likes to see himself as
the hero. Stacy goes to his office in tears, saying that she is
in danger of being accused of plagiarism for copying a paper,
and asks if he can help authenticate her work. Doing this
allows him to come to her rescue, which in turn lets him soak
up some praise; this would allow him to regain Willpower
through his Vice, and as such is enough of a temptation to
raise the impression level back to good. Stacy’s player rolls
Manipulation + Expression for Stacy to compose a letter of
thanks to him, and achieves an exceptional success. The last two Doors open, and Erickson offers to let Stacy borrow the
book for a weekend. He probably even thinks it was his idea.

On the other hand, if Erickson is a player-controlled
character, his player might decide he really doesn’t want
to let that book out of his sight. He might offer an alternative — he’ll bring the book to Stacy, and let her use it for an
afternoon. That, of course, might complicate her intended
demon summoning, but she does get to put the Flattered
Condition on Erickson.

## Hard Leverage Example

Assume Stacy really needs that book
now. She goes to Erickson and threatens him at gunpoint to
give up the book. Doing this is definitely a breaking point for
Stacy. She applies a modifier for her Integrity, and then a modifier based on the
severity of the action and the harm it does to her self-image
and psyche. She’s not in the habit of committing violent acts
and Erickson is obviously terrified, so the Storyteller assigns
a -2 modifier to the breaking point roll. This being the case,
one Door is removed. If she’d shot him the leg to let him
know she was serious, the breaking point modifier would
have been at least -3, which would have removed two Doors.
In either case, her player rolls Presence + Intimidation plus
any bonus for the gun, minus the appropriate penalty.
