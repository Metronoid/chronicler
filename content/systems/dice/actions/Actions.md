# Actions

The majority of actions in the game are instant actions.
They represent acts that only take a couple of seconds. In
combat, an instant action takes up your turn.

A reflexive action is the sort of thing you don’t even need
to think about doing. Most rolls to resist supernatural powers
are reflexive. You can take a reflexive action at any time, and
it doesn’t take your turn in combat.

When two people fight over a specific goal, they engage in a
contested action. You roll your dice pool and the Storyteller (or
other player) rolls the dice pool for the other party. Whoever
rolls the most successes is the victor. Note that you count the

total number of successes rolled when working out if you scored
an exceptional success — don’t subtract the other party’s successes from yours. A contested action takes up the action of
the person initiating the action; resisting it is a reflexive action.

## Extended Actions

An extended action is an attempt to complete a complex
task. You roll your dice pool multiple times. Each roll takes a
certain amount of time, and represents a step in the process
— your character either makes significant progress or faces
a setback. You determine your dice pool for the action as
normal — Attribute + Skill + Modifiers. Make a note of your
Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if any); that’s the maximum
number of times you can roll before the action fails.

When you take an extended action, the Storyteller determines how many successes you require. Most actions require
between five and twenty successes. Five reflects a reasonable
action that competent characters can achieve with the right
tools and knowledge. Ten represents a difficult action that’s
still realistic for a professional in a field. Twenty represents a
very difficult action that even a particularly skilled character
will have trouble pulling off. 

The Storyteller also determines the interval between rolls.
If an action would take weeks to complete, she might consider
one roll per week. If it’s likely to take a day’s work, one roll
per hour makes for a solid timeframe.

### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure**: In addition to the effects of a failure,
the first roll on a further attempt suffers a 2-die penalty.

**Failure**: You face a setback. The Storyteller will offer you
a choice: take a Condition of her choice or abandon the
action. You can offer a different Condition if you think it
makes sense. If you refuse or cannot agree on a Condition,
you lose all accumulated successes.

**Success**: Add the successes scored on the roll to your
running total. Work with the Storyteller to determine what
steps your character has taken towards his goal.

**Exceptional Success**: Choose one of: Reduce the number
of successes required by your character’s Skill dots, reduce the
time on each following roll by a quarter, or apply the exceptional success result of the action when you complete your goal.

## Resistance

Sometimes, an action is resisted. You roll your Attribute
+ Skill, but apply a modifier of one of your opponent’s resistance Attributes (Resolve, Stamina, or Composure), or your
opponent’s Defense. This resistance is over and above any
other modifiers applied to the dice pool.

If you’re not sure whether to use resistance or a contested
action, use this guideline: Resistance applies in situations
where the number of successes on the roll is an important
factor. If what matters is just whether the roll succeeds or not,
use a contested action. For example, combat applies Defense
as a resistance because the number of successes on the roll
determines how badly the attacker messes up his victim. A supernatural power that puts a victim in your thrall uses a
contested action, because the number of successes that you
roll doesn’t matter to the power

## Contested Actions

When two characters are competing, and you only need
to know who comes out on top, use a contested action. In a
contested action, each player rolls a pool for their character
(such as an Attribute + Skill pool), and the character for whom
the most successes are rolled wins the contest.

## Common Actions

Here are some sample ways you can apply your Skills.
Remember, you can invent your own at any time

<Card>
    ## ARGUMENT
    (Intelligence + Expression – victim’s Resolve)

    You try to sway someone with a rational argument. (If
    arguing with a crowd, use the highest Resolve in the crowd.)
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: You convince them of quite the
    opposite.

    • **Failure**: They listen, but are ultimately unaffected.

    • **Success**: They accept the truth (or apparent truth) of
    your words.

    • **Exceptional Success**: They’re convinced, and become
    a recruit to your point of view, though they might
    change their minds if they find themselves at risk.
</Card>

<Card>
    ## CAROUSING
    (Presence + Socialize or Streetwise)

    You mix with a group, bringing high spirits with you and
    using them to loosen tongues.

    • **Dramatic Failure**: A faux pas reveals that you don’t
    belong…and maybe even hints at your supernatural
    nature.

    • **Failure**: You end up a wallflower, with a drink in your
    hand that you don’t even want.

    • **Success**: You make a single-serving friend, who might
    be willing to pass secrets or go with you somewhere
    private.

    • **Exceptional Success**: You make a friend you can
    contact again.
</Card>

<Card>
    ## INTIMIDATION
    (Strength or Manipulation +Intimidation – victim’s Composure)

    You try to get someone to do what you want by making
    them afraid of you.
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: They don’t take you seriously, even
    if you knock them around a bit. They won’t be doing
    what you want.
    
    • **Failure**: They’re unimpressed with your threats.
    
    • **Success**: They’re coerced into helping you.
    
    • **Exceptional Success**: They develop a lasting fear of
    you, which could make them easier to coerce in the
    future.
</Card>

<Card>
	## FAST-TALK 
	(Manipulation + Subterfuge – victim’s Composure)
	
	You may not be able to win the argument with facts, but you can try to get out of trouble with a little judicious spin. 
	
	• **Dramatic Failure**: The other party has a good idea what the truth is. 
	
	• **Failure**: The other party doesn’t believe you. 
	
	• **Success**: The other party swallows your story. 
	
	• **Exceptional Success**: The other party believes you so thoroughly that they’re even willing to offer a little aid…though they won’t put themselves at any kind of risk.
</Card>

<Card>
## INVESTIGATING A SCENE 
(Intelligence + Investigation) 

You look for clues to what’s happened in the recent past… or tidy up so that no one else can find them. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You find clues, but you contaminate them, or you leave evidence of your presence. 

• **Failure**: You find evidence, but it’s damaged and hard to interpret. Alternately, you miss a spot in your cleanup that you won’t find out about until later. 

• **Success**: You find a clue of exactly the sort you need, or manage to significantly confuse future investigators. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find a clue and know exactly how it fits in, or you leave the scene immaculate and impossible to decipher.
</Card>

<Card>
## INTERROGATION 
(Manipulation + Empathy or Intimidation – victim’s Resolve)

You try to dig secrets out of a reluctant informant.

• **Dramatic Failure**: The informant is so alienated or injured that he will no longer reveal information. 

• **Failure**: The informant blabs a mix of truth and falsehood — even he may not know the difference. 

• **Success**: You get the information you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You get the information you were looking for, and the informant is willing to continue cooperating.
</Card>

<Card>
## JUMPING 
(Strength + Athletics) 

To get past an obstacle or get out of danger, you leap into the air. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: The task not only fails but your character loses her balance. 

• **Failure**: Your character doesn’t achieve any significant distance at all — she jumps too early, has a false start, or loses her nerve. 

• **Success**: Your character leaps a number of feet equal to the successes rolled, or a number of meters equal to the successes rolled divided by three. 

• **Exceptional Success**: Your character leaps an impressive distance. If successes gained exceed the amount required to make the jump, your character may attempt another instant action in the air (say, firing a shot) or upon landing (maybe running up to her Speed), at the Storyteller’s discretion.
</Card>

<Card>
## RESEARCH 
(Intelligence + Academics or Occult) 

Using your existing knowledge, you look for information on a current mystery. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You learn something, but it doesn’t help. In fact, it sets you back. If using Occult, this could mean dangerously false assumptions. 

• **Failure**: You turn up a lot of promising leads, but they’re all dead ends. 

• **Success**: You find the basic facts you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find what you were looking for, as well as leads toward a much bigger score of information.
</Card>

<Card>
## SHADOWING A MARK
(Wits + Stealth or Drive vs. Wits + Composure) 

You follow someone, perhaps in the hopes of ambushing them, or of finding out their destination. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You’re caught, either by the mark or some observer that’s become suspicious of you. 

• **Failure**: The mark senses he’s being followed, and manages to lose you. 

• **Success**: You follow the mark to his destination. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find some means by which you can continue following the mark, such as an unlocked entrance into the building at which he arrived.
</Card>

<Card>
## SNEAKING 
(Dexterity + Stealth vs. Wits + Composure) 

You’re trying to avoid notice by someone…or multiple someones. Maybe you want to get into a place undetected. Maybe you’re trying to break out. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You attract a lot of attention… enough that now it’s going to be hard to get out. 

• **Failure**: You’re noticed, but still have the chance to slip away. 

• **Success**: You avoid notice and get closer to your goal. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You avoid notice and get away before anyone has another chance to catch you.
