# **Actions: Different ways to roll**
Actions in the game are categorized as instant, reflexive, and contested. Instant actions are quick and take only a few seconds to perform, consuming your turn in combat. Reflexive actions, like resisting supernatural powers, are automatic and can be performed at any time without taking a turn in combat. Contested actions happen when two parties compete over a goal, and each side rolls their dice pool. The character with the most successes wins the contest, and the initiating party's action is consumed. Resisting a contested action is considered a reflexive action.

## **Extended Actions**
Extended actions refer to complex tasks that require multiple dice rolls. The dice pool is calculated as Attribute + Skill + Modifiers, with a maximum number of rolls determined by Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if applicable). The Storyteller sets the required number of successes (ranging from 5 to 20) and the interval between rolls (ranging from hours to weeks).

### **Roll Results**

**Dramatic Failure**: In addition to failure effects, the next attempt suffers a 2-die penalty.\
**Failure**: A setback occurs, and the Storyteller offers a choice of accepting a Condition or abandoning the action. Refusal or inability to agree on a Condition results in loss of all accumulated successes.\
**Success**: Add the number of successes rolled to the running total, and work with the Storyteller to determine progress.\
**Exceptional Success**: The player can choose to reduce the number of required successes, reduce the time between rolls, or apply the exceptional success result upon completion.

## **Resistance Roll**
When the number of successes on a roll is a crucial factor, a resistance roll is used. The dice pool is Attribute + Skill, with a modifier of the opponent's resistance Attribute (Resolve, Stamina, or Composure) or Defense.

## **Contested Actions**
Contested actions are used when two characters compete, and it's only important to know who comes out on top. Each character rolls their dice pool (such as Attribute + Skill), and the character with the most successes wins the contest.

    ## ARGUMENT
    (Intelligence + Expression – victim’s Resolve)

    You try to sway someone with a rational argument. (If
    arguing with a crowd, use the highest Resolve in the crowd.)
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: You convince them of quite the
    opposite.

    • **Failure**: They listen, but are ultimately unaffected.

    • **Success**: They accept the truth (or apparent truth) of
    your words.

    • **Exceptional Success**: They’re convinced, and become
    a recruit to your point of view, though they might
    change their minds if they find themselves at risk.

    ## CAROUSING
    (Presence + Socialize or Streetwise)

    You mix with a group, bringing high spirits with you and
    using them to loosen tongues.

    • **Dramatic Failure**: A faux pas reveals that you don’t
    belong…and maybe even hints at your supernatural
    nature.

    • **Failure**: You end up a wallflower, with a drink in your
    hand that you don’t even want.

    • **Success**: You make a single-serving friend, who might
    be willing to pass secrets or go with you somewhere
    private.

    • **Exceptional Success**: You make a friend you can
    contact again.
</Card>

    ## INTIMIDATION
    (Strength or Manipulation +Intimidation – victim’s Composure)

    You try to get someone to do what you want by making
    them afraid of you.
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: They don’t take you seriously, even
    if you knock them around a bit. They won’t be doing
    what you want.
    
    • **Failure**: They’re unimpressed with your threats.
    
    • **Success**: They’re coerced into helping you.
    
    • **Exceptional Success**: They develop a lasting fear of
    you, which could make them easier to coerce in the
    future.
</Card>

<Card>
	## FAST-TALK 
	(Manipulation + Subterfuge – victim’s Composure)

	• **Dramatic Failure**: The other party has a good idea what the truth is. 
	
	• **Failure**: The other party doesn’t believe you. 
	
	• **Success**: The other party swallows your story.

</Card>

<Card>
## INVESTIGATING A SCENE 
(Intelligence + Investigation) 

You look for clues to what’s happened in the recent past… or tidy up so that no one else can find them. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You find clues, but you contaminate them, or you leave evidence of your presence. 

• **Failure**: You find evidence, but it’s damaged and hard to interpret. Alternately, you miss a spot in your cleanup that you won’t find out about until later. 

• **Success**: You find a clue of exactly the sort you need, or manage to significantly confuse future investigators. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find a clue and know exactly how it fits in, or you leave the scene immaculate and impossible to decipher.
</Card>

<Card>
## INTERROGATION 
(Manipulation + Empathy or Intimidation – victim’s Resolve)

You try to dig secrets out of a reluctant informant.

• **Dramatic Failure**: The informant is so alienated or injured that he will no longer reveal information. 

• **Failure**: The informant blabs a mix of truth and falsehood — even he may not know the difference. 

• **Success**: You get the information you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You get the information you were looking for, and the informant is willing to continue cooperating.
</Card>

<Card>
## JUMPING 
(Strength + Athletics) 

To get past an obstacle or get out of danger, you leap into the air. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: The task not only fails but your character loses her balance. 

• **Failure**: Your character doesn’t achieve any significant distance at all — she jumps too early, has a false start, or loses her nerve. 

• **Success**: Your character leaps a number of feet equal to the successes rolled, or a number of meters equal to the successes rolled divided by three. 

• **Exceptional Success**: Your character leaps an impressive distance. If successes gained exceed the amount required to make the jump, your character may attempt another instant action in the air (say, firing a shot) or upon landing (maybe running up to her Speed), at the Storyteller’s discretion.
</Card>

<Card>
## RESEARCH 
(Intelligence + Academics or Occult) 

Using your existing knowledge, you look for information on a current mystery. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You learn something, but it doesn’t help. In fact, it sets you back. If using Occult, this could mean dangerously false assumptions. 

• **Failure**: You turn up a lot of promising leads, but they’re all dead ends. 

• **Success**: You find the basic facts you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find what you were looking for, as well as leads toward a much bigger score of information.
</Card>

<Card>
## SHADOWING A MARK
(Wits + Stealth or Drive vs. Wits + Composure) 

You follow someone, perhaps in the hopes of ambushing them, or of finding out their destination. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You’re caught, either by the mark or some observer that’s become suspicious of you. 

• **Failure**: The mark senses he’s being followed, and manages to lose you. 

• **Success**: You follow the mark to his destination. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find some means by which you can continue following the mark, such as an unlocked entrance into the building at which he arrived.
</Card>

<Card>
## SNEAKING 
(Dexterity + Stealth vs. Wits + Composure) 

You’re trying to avoid notice by someone…or multiple someones. Maybe you want to get into a place undetected. Maybe you’re trying to break out. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You attract a lot of attention… enough that now it’s going to be hard to get out. 

• **Failure**: You’re noticed, but still have the chance to slip away. 

• **Success**: You avoid notice and get closer to your goal. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You avoid notice and get away before anyone has another chance to catch you.
