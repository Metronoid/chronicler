# Skill Specialties

While Skills describe a character’s broad knowledge and
training, Skill Specialties describe particular areas of expertise. A Specialty should be narrower than its Skill, but not
so narrow that it’s usually irrelevant. Each Skill in Chapter 1
lists a few example Specialties as a guideline. The Storyteller
is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes a Specialty.

Characters begin play with three Specialties, and players
can purchase more with Experiences. A character may have
any number of Specialties for a given Skill, but only one
instance of each Specialty. Specialties can help flesh out thecharacter’s background and define her go-to solutions to problems. For example, a character with Firearms 3 and a Specialty
in Rifles is capable with all guns, but particularly good with
rifles. She’ll default to a rifle when she can, because that’s
what she does best. Players should come up with backstory
reasons for Specialties — perhaps the character used to hunt
with her grandfather as a youth.

Whenever a Specialty applies to a player’s roll with the
relevant Skill, she adds one die, which stacks with other situational modifiers. Multiple Specialties may apply to a single
roll with Storyteller approval. If a player goes to great lengths
to justify a Specialty, it probably shouldn’t apply.
