# Willpower

A character’s Willpower represents her determination and
her ability to go above and beyond what should be possible
to achieve her goals. Spending a point of Willpower adds
a three-die bonus to most dice pools, or +2 to a Resistance
trait. You can only spend one point of Willpower per action.

A character regains one point of spent Willpower for each
full night’s sleep she gets.
