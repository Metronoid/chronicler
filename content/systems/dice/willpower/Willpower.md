# **Willpower**

Willpower is a character's determination and drive to achieve their goals. Spending a point of Willpower grants a +3 bonus to most dice pools or +2 to a Resistance trait, but only one point can be spent per action. A character can regain a spent point of Willpower by getting a full night's sleep.

## **Anchors**

Acting in accordance with your Virtue or Vice during a scene can restore your Willpower. If the Storyteller judges your actions reflect your Vice, you regain 1 spent Willpower point. If your actions reflect your Virtue and posed difficulty/risk, you regain all spent Willpower, up to twice per game session.
