# Anchors

When a character acts in accordance with his Virtue or
Vice during a scene, his sense of self is reinforced and his
reserves of inner strength refreshed.

If the Storyteller judges that your character’s actions during a scene reflect his Vice, he regains one spent Willpower
point. Note that acting on a Virtue or Vice does not need to
pose difficulty or risk to your character.

If the Storyteller judges that your character’s actions during a scene reflected her Virtue while posing her difficulty
or risk, she regains all spent Willpower. She may regain
Willpower up to twice per game session in this way.
