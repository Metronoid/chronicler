# **Time**

The pace of time in the story can vary greatly compared to real life. A tense negotiation could take hours or weeks, while weeks or months could pass in just a few words.

There are five units of dramatic time used in the game, starting with the smallest:

• **Turn** (3 sec) - A character can perform a single instant action during a turn, used mainly in combat or stressful situations.

• **Scene** - A scene is a specific event and its resolution. The storyteller sets the scene and players resolve it. The scene can be played in turns or progress in real time.

• **Chapter** - A collection of scenes that occur during one game session.

• **Story** - A complete tale with an introduction, rising tension, twists, and a conclusion. Can be made up of multiple chapters or just one.

• **Chronicle** - A collection of interconnected stories involving the characters. They can be linked by a common theme or plotline or just shared characters and locations. The storyteller and players work together to create an ongoing chronicle
