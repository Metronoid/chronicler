# Rolling Dice
When your character is trying to accomplish something and the outcome is in
doubt, you roll a pool of ten-sided dice based on his relevant traits and read the
results to determine success. Most of the time, you roll a number of dice equal to
an Attribute plus a Skill. For example, to get the cop off your back, you use your
character’s Manipulation Attribute of 4 and Subterfuge Skill of 3, so you roll seven dice. If you have a Specialty that’s relevant to the roll,
add an extra die to your pool.

Each die that shows an 8, 9, or 10 is a success. Normally, you
only need one success to achieve your goal. It’s always better to
get more successes, though, especially if you want to hurt someone, since your successes add to your damage when attacking.

Every die that comes up as a 10 is a success. You also
roll the die again, potentially scoring another success. If this
second roll comes up as another 10, count the success and
roll it again, on until you roll a number other than 10.

Many rolls have modifiers, either from equipment,
circumstance, or someone working against your character.
Most modifiers are within the range of +3 to -3, though they
can range as low as -5 or as high as +5. Apply the modifiers
to your dice pool before you roll. Add all the bonuses first,
then apply penalties.

If your pool drops below one die, you instead roll a single
chance die. The chance die only counts as a success if you roll
a 10, which you do not reroll. Any other result is a failure.
If you roll a 1 on the chance die, your character suffers a
dramatic failure.

### Roll Results

Your roll can succeed and fail in a few different ways:

**Success**: Your character’s action goes off as planned.
Achieved by having at least one success (a die showing 8, 9,
or 10; or a chance die showing 10).

**Failure**: Your character’s action fails. This doesn’t mean
“nothing happens,” just that she doesn’t get what she wants
and complications are headed her way. Occurs when you
roll no successes.

**Exceptional Success**: Your character’s action succeeds
beyond her expectations. Achieved by rolling five or more
successes. Your character gains a beneficial Condition. (See
“Conditions,” p. 75.) Usually, the Inspired Condition is the
most appropriate. You can give this Condition to another
character when it’s appropriate to the story.

**Dramatic Failure**: Your character fails badly, and things
are about to get a whole lot worse. Suffered when you roll a 1
on a chance die. Alternately you can take a Beat in exchange
for turning a normal failure into a dramatic failure.

## When to Roll Dice

For many actions, you don’t need to roll dice. If your
character isn’t in a stressful situation — nobody’s actively
trying to tear his throat open, or demolish the building as he
works — you don’t need to roll. When the dice hit the table,
the Storyteller should have some idea of what will happen
if the roll fails, as well as if it succeeds. Sometimes that’s
coded in the rules. If you fail on an attack roll, you don’t
deal any damage. Other times, it’s up to the Storyteller. If
you fail a roll to jump between buildings with the prince’s
hit-squad on your tail, do you make it but fall on the other
side, grab the next building by your fingertips, or plummet
to the alley below?

### Circumstance and Equipment

Sometimes, fortune favors your character. Other times,
she gives it a helping hand by packing the right tools for the
job. The Storyteller should weigh how the circumstances
affect a character’s chance of success. A slight advantage —
picking an old and damaged lock — might be worth a bonus
die, while a stressful situation — trying to pick a lock while
people are shooting at you — might subtract three dice from
your pool. Most of the time, the modifier from circumstances
will be between +3 and –3, though in very rare cases — picking
a lock while the room is on fire — it can range from +5 to –5.

Bringing the right equipment for a task also gives you extra
dice to roll. A sharp suit might give you bonus dice when trying to convince the CEO that your character knows the best
plan, while a good pair of running shoes will help her escape
from the things lurking in the shadows. Most equipment offers a one to three die bonus. A top-of-the-line or custom item
might give a four or five die bonus, but such items often cost
more than just money. When a task is impossible without
some kind of equipment — hacking a computer, or driving
a car — equipment bonuses indicate how far your tools are
above the baseline. A beat-up old station wagon might not
add any dice to a Drive roll, but a top-of-the-line sports car
may add four or even five dice.

## Attribute Tasks

Some actions require no special expertise to perform.
Mostly, these come in the form of Wits + Composure rolls to
notice something that doesn’t seem right, or using Strength +
Stamina rolls to lift something. For these rolls, you add two
different Attributes together to make your dice pool. If an
action doesn’t seem to involve any particular Skill, it can be
handled by an Attribute Task. 

## Muddling Through

If your character has no dots in an applicable Skill, the
Storyteller may allow you to roll your Attribute as a dice
pool. Your character’s dice pool suffers a penalty for being
untrained: if the roll would involve a Mental Skill, you take
a three-die penalty, while a Physical or Social Skill applies a
one-die penalty.

## Permutations

The Storytelling System has a few variations in how dice rolls work. 

• **9-Again**: You reroll dice that show 9 or 10, as opposed to just 10. Keep rolling until you get a result that isn’t a 9 or 10. 

• **8-Again**: You reroll dice that show 8, 9, or 10 — any successful die — and keep rolling as long as your dice show successes. 

• **Extra Successes**: Assuming your roll succeeds, you get a number of extra successes added to your total. This permutation mostly applies to weapons, which add their damage bonus as extra successes on your attack roll. 

• **Rote Actions**: When you’ve got plenty of training and the steps you need to follow are laid out in front of you, you’ve got a significant chance of success. When you make a roll, you can reroll any dice that do not show an 8, 9, or 10. If you’re reduced to a chance die on a rote action, don’t reroll a dramatic failure. You may only reroll each die once. 

• **Successive Attempts**: When you fail a roll, you may be able to try again. If time is not an issue and your character is under no pressure to perform, you may make successive attempts with your full dice pool. In the far more likely situation that time is short and the situation is tense, each subsequent attempt has a cumulative one-die penalty — so the third time a character tries to break down the door that’s keeping her inside a burning building, her roll has a two- die penalty. Successive attempts do not apply to extended actions. 

• **Teamwork**: When two or more people work together, one person takes the lead. He’s the primary actor, and his player assembles his dice pool as normal. Anyone assisting rolls the same pool before the primary actor. Each success from a secondary actor gives the primary actor a bonus die. If one of the secondary actors rolls a dramatic failure, the primary actor takes a four-die penalty.
