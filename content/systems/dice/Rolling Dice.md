# Rolling Dice
When your character is trying to accomplish something and the outcome is in
doubt, you roll a pool of ten-sided dice based on his relevant traits and read the
results to determine success. Most of the time, you roll a number of dice equal to
an Attribute plus a Skill. For example, to get the cop off your back, you use your
character’s Manipulation Attribute of 4 and Subterfuge Skill of 3, so you roll seven dice. If you have a Specialty that’s relevant to the roll,
add an extra die to your pool.

Each die that shows an 8, 9, or 10 is a success. Normally, you
only need one success to achieve your goal. It’s always better to
get more successes, though, especially if you want to hurt someone, since your successes add to your damage when attacking.

Every die that comes up as a 10 is a success. You also
roll the die again, potentially scoring another success. If this
second roll comes up as another 10, count the success and
roll it again, on until you roll a number other than 10.

Many rolls have modifiers, either from equipment,
circumstance, or someone working against your character.
Most modifiers are within the range of +3 to -3, though they
can range as low as -5 or as high as +5. Apply the modifiers
to your dice pool before you roll. Add all the bonuses first,
then apply penalties.

If your pool drops below one die, you instead roll a single
chance die. The chance die only counts as a success if you roll
a 10, which you do not reroll. Any other result is a failure.
If you roll a 1 on the chance die, your character suffers a
dramatic failure.

### Roll Results

Your roll can succeed and fail in a few different ways:

**Success**: Your character’s action goes off as planned.
Achieved by having at least one success (a die showing 8, 9,
or 10; or a chance die showing 10).

**Failure**: Your character’s action fails. This doesn’t mean
“nothing happens,” just that she doesn’t get what she wants
and complications are headed her way. Occurs when you
roll no successes.

**Exceptional Success**: Your character’s action succeeds
beyond her expectations. Achieved by rolling five or more
successes. Your character gains a beneficial Condition. (See
“Conditions,” p. 75.) Usually, the Inspired Condition is the
most appropriate. You can give this Condition to another
character when it’s appropriate to the story.

**Dramatic Failure**: Your character fails badly, and things
are about to get a whole lot worse. Suffered when you roll a 1
on a chance die. Alternately you can take a Beat in exchange
for turning a normal failure into a dramatic failure.

## When to Roll Dice

For many actions, you don’t need to roll dice. If your
character isn’t in a stressful situation — nobody’s actively
trying to tear his throat open, or demolish the building as he
works — you don’t need to roll. When the dice hit the table,
the Storyteller should have some idea of what will happen
if the roll fails, as well as if it succeeds. Sometimes that’s
coded in the rules. If you fail on an attack roll, you don’t
deal any damage. Other times, it’s up to the Storyteller. If
you fail a roll to jump between buildings with the prince’s
hit-squad on your tail, do you make it but fall on the other
side, grab the next building by your fingertips, or plummet
to the alley below?

### Circumstance and Equipment

Sometimes, fortune favors your character. Other times,
she gives it a helping hand by packing the right tools for the
job. The Storyteller should weigh how the circumstances
affect a character’s chance of success. A slight advantage —
picking an old and damaged lock — might be worth a bonus
die, while a stressful situation — trying to pick a lock while
people are shooting at you — might subtract three dice from
your pool. Most of the time, the modifier from circumstances
will be between +3 and –3, though in very rare cases — picking
a lock while the room is on fire — it can range from +5 to –5.

Bringing the right equipment for a task also gives you extra
dice to roll. A sharp suit might give you bonus dice when trying to convince the CEO that your character knows the best
plan, while a good pair of running shoes will help her escape
from the things lurking in the shadows. Most equipment offers a one to three die bonus. A top-of-the-line or custom item
might give a four or five die bonus, but such items often cost
more than just money. When a task is impossible without
some kind of equipment — hacking a computer, or driving
a car — equipment bonuses indicate how far your tools are
above the baseline. A beat-up old station wagon might not
add any dice to a Drive roll, but a top-of-the-line sports car
may add four or even five dice.

## Attribute Tasks

Some actions require no special expertise to perform.
Mostly, these come in the form of Wits + Composure rolls to
notice something that doesn’t seem right, or using Strength +
Stamina rolls to lift something. For these rolls, you add two
different Attributes together to make your dice pool. If an
action doesn’t seem to involve any particular Skill, it can be
handled by an Attribute Task. 

## Muddling Through

If your character has no dots in an applicable Skill, the
Storyteller may allow you to roll your Attribute as a dice
pool. Your character’s dice pool suffers a penalty for being
untrained: if the roll would involve a Mental Skill, you take
a three-die penalty, while a Physical or Social Skill applies a
one-die penalty.

## Actions

The majority of actions in the game are instant actions.
They represent acts that only take a couple of seconds. In
combat, an instant action takes up your turn.

A reflexive action is the sort of thing you don’t even need
to think about doing. Most rolls to resist supernatural powers
are reflexive. You can take a reflexive action at any time, and
it doesn’t take your turn in combat.

When two people fight over a specific goal, they engage in a
contested action. You roll your dice pool and the Storyteller (or
other player) rolls the dice pool for the other party. Whoever
rolls the most successes is the victor. Note that you count the

total number of successes rolled when working out if you scored
an exceptional success — don’t subtract the other party’s successes from yours. A contested action takes up the action of
the person initiating the action; resisting it is a reflexive action.

## Extended Actions

An extended action is an attempt to complete a complex
task. You roll your dice pool multiple times. Each roll takes a
certain amount of time, and represents a step in the process
— your character either makes significant progress or faces
a setback. You determine your dice pool for the action as
normal — Attribute + Skill + Modifiers. Make a note of your
Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if any); that’s the maximum
number of times you can roll before the action fails.

When you take an extended action, the Storyteller determines how many successes you require. Most actions require
between five and twenty successes. Five reflects a reasonable
action that competent characters can achieve with the right
tools and knowledge. Ten represents a difficult action that’s
still realistic for a professional in a field. Twenty represents a
very difficult action that even a particularly skilled character
will have trouble pulling off. 

The Storyteller also determines the interval between rolls.
If an action would take weeks to complete, she might consider
one roll per week. If it’s likely to take a day’s work, one roll
per hour makes for a solid timeframe.

### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure**: In addition to the effects of a failure,
the first roll on a further attempt suffers a 2-die penalty.

**Failure**: You face a setback. The Storyteller will offer you
a choice: take a Condition of her choice or abandon the
action. You can offer a different Condition if you think it
makes sense. If you refuse or cannot agree on a Condition,
you lose all accumulated successes.

**Success**: Add the successes scored on the roll to your
running total. Work with the Storyteller to determine what
steps your character has taken towards his goal.

**Exceptional Success**: Choose one of: Reduce the number
of successes required by your character’s Skill dots, reduce the
time on each following roll by a quarter, or apply the exceptional success result of the action when you complete your goal.

## Resistance

Sometimes, an action is resisted. You roll your Attribute
+ Skill, but apply a modifier of one of your opponent’s resistance Attributes (Resolve, Stamina, or Composure), or your
opponent’s Defense. This resistance is over and above any
other modifiers applied to the dice pool.

If you’re not sure whether to use resistance or a contested
action, use this guideline: Resistance applies in situations
where the number of successes on the roll is an important
factor. If what matters is just whether the roll succeeds or not,
use a contested action. For example, combat applies Defense
as a resistance because the number of successes on the roll
determines how badly the attacker messes up his victim. A supernatural power that puts a victim in your thrall uses a
contested action, because the number of successes that you
roll doesn’t matter to the power

## Contested Actions

When two characters are competing, and you only need
to know who comes out on top, use a contested action. In a
contested action, each player rolls a pool for their character
(such as an Attribute + Skill pool), and the character for whom
the most successes are rolled wins the contest.

## Common Actions

Here are some sample ways you can apply your Skills.
Remember, you can invent your own at any time

<Card>
    ## ARGUMENT
    (Intelligence + Expression – victim’s Resolve)

    You try to sway someone with a rational argument. (If
    arguing with a crowd, use the highest Resolve in the crowd.)
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: You convince them of quite the
    opposite.

    • **Failure**: They listen, but are ultimately unaffected.

    • **Success**: They accept the truth (or apparent truth) of
    your words.

    • **Exceptional Success**: They’re convinced, and become
    a recruit to your point of view, though they might
    change their minds if they find themselves at risk.
</Card>

<Card>
    ## CAROUSING
    (Presence + Socialize or Streetwise)

    You mix with a group, bringing high spirits with you and
    using them to loosen tongues.

    • **Dramatic Failure**: A faux pas reveals that you don’t
    belong…and maybe even hints at your supernatural
    nature.

    • **Failure**: You end up a wallflower, with a drink in your
    hand that you don’t even want.

    • **Success**: You make a single-serving friend, who might
    be willing to pass secrets or go with you somewhere
    private.

    • **Exceptional Success**: You make a friend you can
    contact again.
</Card>

<Card>
    ## INTIMIDATION
    (Strength or Manipulation +Intimidation – victim’s Composure)

    You try to get someone to do what you want by making
    them afraid of you.
    
    • **Dramatic Failure**: They don’t take you seriously, even
    if you knock them around a bit. They won’t be doing
    what you want.
    
    • **Failure**: They’re unimpressed with your threats.
    
    • **Success**: They’re coerced into helping you.
    
    • **Exceptional Success**: They develop a lasting fear of
    you, which could make them easier to coerce in the
    future.
</Card>

<Card>
	## FAST-TALK 
	(Manipulation + Subterfuge – victim’s Composure)
	
	You may not be able to win the argument with facts, but you can try to get out of trouble with a little judicious spin. 
	
	• **Dramatic Failure**: The other party has a good idea what the truth is. 
	
	• **Failure**: The other party doesn’t believe you. 
	
	• **Success**: The other party swallows your story. 
	
	• **Exceptional Success**: The other party believes you so thoroughly that they’re even willing to offer a little aid…though they won’t put themselves at any kind of risk.
</Card>

<Card>
## INVESTIGATING A SCENE 
(Intelligence + Investigation) 

You look for clues to what’s happened in the recent past… or tidy up so that no one else can find them. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You find clues, but you contaminate them, or you leave evidence of your presence. 

• **Failure**: You find evidence, but it’s damaged and hard to interpret. Alternately, you miss a spot in your cleanup that you won’t find out about until later. 

• **Success**: You find a clue of exactly the sort you need, or manage to significantly confuse future investigators. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find a clue and know exactly how it fits in, or you leave the scene immaculate and impossible to decipher.
</Card>

<Card>
## INTERROGATION 
(Manipulation + Empathy or Intimidation – victim’s Resolve)

You try to dig secrets out of a reluctant informant.

• **Dramatic Failure**: The informant is so alienated or injured that he will no longer reveal information. 

• **Failure**: The informant blabs a mix of truth and falsehood — even he may not know the difference. 

• **Success**: You get the information you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You get the information you were looking for, and the informant is willing to continue cooperating.
</Card>

<Card>
## JUMPING 
(Strength + Athletics) 

To get past an obstacle or get out of danger, you leap into the air. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: The task not only fails but your character loses her balance. 

• **Failure**: Your character doesn’t achieve any significant distance at all — she jumps too early, has a false start, or loses her nerve. 

• **Success**: Your character leaps a number of feet equal to the successes rolled, or a number of meters equal to the successes rolled divided by three. 

• **Exceptional Success**: Your character leaps an impressive distance. If successes gained exceed the amount required to make the jump, your character may attempt another instant action in the air (say, firing a shot) or upon landing (maybe running up to her Speed), at the Storyteller’s discretion.
</Card>

<Card>
## RESEARCH 
(Intelligence + Academics or Occult) 

Using your existing knowledge, you look for information on a current mystery. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You learn something, but it doesn’t help. In fact, it sets you back. If using Occult, this could mean dangerously false assumptions. 

• **Failure**: You turn up a lot of promising leads, but they’re all dead ends. 

• **Success**: You find the basic facts you were looking for. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find what you were looking for, as well as leads toward a much bigger score of information.
</Card>

<Card>
**SHADOWING A MARK** 
(Wits + Stealth or Drive vs. Wits + Composure) 

You follow someone, perhaps in the hopes of ambushing them, or of finding out their destination. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You’re caught, either by the mark or some observer that’s become suspicious of you. 

• **Failure**: The mark senses he’s being followed, and manages to lose you. 

• **Success**: You follow the mark to his destination. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You find some means by which you can continue following the mark, such as an unlocked entrance into the building at which he arrived.
</Card>

<Card>
## SNEAKING 
(Dexterity + Stealth vs. Wits + Composure) 

You’re trying to avoid notice by someone…or multiple someones. Maybe you want to get into a place undetected. Maybe you’re trying to break out. 

• **Dramatic Failure**: You attract a lot of attention… enough that now it’s going to be hard to get out. 

• **Failure**: You’re noticed, but still have the chance to slip away. 

• **Success**: You avoid notice and get closer to your goal. 

• **Exceptional Success**: You avoid notice and get away before anyone has another chance to catch you.
</Card>

## Permutations

The Storytelling System has a few variations in how dice rolls work. 

• **9-Again**: You reroll dice that show 9 or 10, as opposed to just 10. Keep rolling until you get a result that isn’t a 9 or 10. 

• **8-Again**: You reroll dice that show 8, 9, or 10 — any successful die — and keep rolling as long as your dice show successes. 

• **Extra Successes**: Assuming your roll succeeds, you get a number of extra successes added to your total. This permutation mostly applies to weapons, which add their damage bonus as extra successes on your attack roll. 

• **Rote Actions**: When you’ve got plenty of training and the steps you need to follow are laid out in front of you, you’ve got a significant chance of success. When you make a roll, you can reroll any dice that do not show an 8, 9, or 10. If you’re reduced to a chance die on a rote action, don’t reroll a dramatic failure. You may only reroll each die once. 

• **Successive Attempts**: When you fail a roll, you may be able to try again. If time is not an issue and your character is under no pressure to perform, you may make successive attempts with your full dice pool. In the far more likely situation that time is short and the situation is tense, each subsequent attempt has a cumulative one-die penalty — so the third time a character tries to break down the door that’s keeping her inside a burning building, her roll has a two- die penalty. Successive attempts do not apply to extended actions. 

• **Teamwork**: When two or more people work together, one person takes the lead. He’s the primary actor, and his player assembles his dice pool as normal. Anyone assisting rolls the same pool before the primary actor. Each success from a secondary actor gives the primary actor a bonus die. If one of the secondary actors rolls a dramatic failure, the primary actor takes a four-die penalty.

## Time

When you’re playing out stories in the Chronicles of Darkness, time in the story can speed past or slow to a crawl compared to time in the real world. Weeks or months might pass in the space of a few words, while a tense negotiation plays out in real time — or takes even longer. 

In addition to years, nights, and hours, the Chronicles of Darkness also uses five units of dramatic time. These build on one another, from shortest to longest. 

• **Turn** — The smallest increment of time, a turn lasts for about three seconds. A character can perform a single instant action in a turn. Turns normally only matter in combat or other dramatic and stressful situations. 

• **Scene** — Much like a scene in a play, a scene in a roleplaying game is the time spent dealing with a single, specific event. The Storyteller frames the scene, describing what’s going on, and it’s up to the players to resolve the event or conflict. A scene might be played out in turns, progress in real time, or skip forward, depending on dramatic necessity. 

• **Chapter** — A chapter is the collection of scenes that happen during one game session. From the moment you sit down and start playing to the point where you pack up your dice, you’re playing out a chapter of your story. 

• **Story** — A story tells an entire tale, following the dramatic arc of a related series of events. It might be comprised of several chapters or be completed in just one. It has an introduction, rising tension, a number of twists, and a climax that brings things to a conclusion. 

• **Chronicle** — The big picture; a chronicle is the collection of interlinked stories that involve your characters. They might be linked by a common theme or overarching plotline, or they may only share characters and locations. As your story progresses, the players and Storyteller work together to create an ongoing chronicle.
