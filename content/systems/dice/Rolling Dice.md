# **Rolling Dice**
To determine the success of a task, a pool of 10-sided dice must be rolled based on the relevant Attribute and Skill, with an extra die added in the case where there is a relevant Specialty. The number of dice in the pool can be influenced by various Modifiers, ranging from +3 to -3, that apply to the pool before any rolls are made. A roll of 8, 9, or 10 is considered a success, and if a die lands on 10, it can be rerolled until a value other than 10 is rolled. Each additional roll of 8, 9 or 10 is counted as another success. 

In the event that the pool of dice drops below one, a single chance die must be rolled, with the result of 1 resulting in a dramatic failure, and a result of 10 resulting in a success.

## **Roll Outcomes:**

**Success**: The action is successful with at least 1 success (a die of 8, 9, or 10, or a chance die of 10).

**Failure**: The action is unsuccessful, leading to complications. No successes are rolled.

**Exceptional Success**: The action exceeds expectations, with 5 or more successes rolled. The character earns a beneficial Condition, usually the Inspired Condition.

**Dramatic Failure**: The action fails dramatically, resulting in a worsening situation. Rolled by a 1 on the chance die or by taking a Beat in exchange for a normal failure.

## **When to Roll Dice**

Dice rolls are necessary during stressful situations, when failure could lead to a negative outcome. The Storyteller should have a clear understanding of the potential outcome if the roll succeeds or fails. Rules determine the consequences of failure in some cases, like failing an attack roll means no damage dealt. The outcome of other situations is determined by the Storyteller's discretion, such as when failing a roll to jump between buildings while pursued.

### Circumstance and Equipment

The Storyteller should consider how the situation and the character's equipment can impact the outcome of a roll. A positive circumstance, such as a damaged lock, may add a bonus die, while a negative circumstance, like being shot at while trying to pick a lock, may subtract dice from your pool. Modifiers usually range from +3 to -3, but in rare cases can range from +5 to -5.

Having the right equipment for a task also adds bonus dice to your roll, with equipment offering a 1-3 die bonus and high-end equipment offering a 4-5 die bonus. In some cases, equipment is essential to perform a task and the bonus indicates the level of quality compared to baseline equipment.

## **Attribute-Based Tasks**
Some actions can be performed without special expertise, often in the form of Wits + Composure rolls to detect something odd, or Strength + Stamina rolls to lift an object. These rolls are determined by adding two different Attributes. If a task doesn't require a specific Skill, it can be done with an Attribute Task.

## **Muddling Through Without Skill**
If your character lacks the required Skill, the Storyteller may allow you to use the Attribute instead with a penalty. Mental Skills impose a 3-die penalty, while Physical or Social Skills impose a 1-die penalty.

## **Dice Roll Variations**

**9-Again**: Reroll dice that show 9 or 10, and continue until you get a result other than 9 or 10.

**8-Again**: Reroll dice that show 8, 9, or 10, and keep rolling as long as you get successes.

**Extra Successes**: If your roll succeeds, you get additional successes. This is mostly applied to weapons that add their damage bonus as extra successes on attack rolls.

**Rote Actions**: If you have enough training and the steps are clear, you have a good chance of success. Reroll any dice that don't show 8, 9, or 10. Don't reroll dramatic failures, and each die can only be rerolled once.

**Successive Attempts**: You can try again if you fail a roll. If time is not limited and there's no pressure, you can try again with the full dice pool. If time is short and the situation is tense, each subsequent attempt has a cumulative one-die penalty. Successive attempts don't apply to extended actions.

**Teamwork**: When working together, one person leads and rolls their dice pool as normal. Assistants roll the same pool and each success gives the leader a bonus die. If an assistant rolls a dramatic failure, the leader takes a four-die penalty.
