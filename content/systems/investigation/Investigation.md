# Investigation

The Chronicles of Darkness are tales of mystery, and protagonists are driven to uncover them. For a casual, momentary
investigation that shouldn’t play a deep role in the story, you
can use a single dice roll to represent the effort. However, investigations can become the foundation for extended scenes,
for stories, and even for entire chronicles. This system allows
for more depth than the standard dice mechanics. 

At its core, this system is about uncovering and accumulating Clues, which serve to benefit later actions. Usually, the investigation is a means to an end. Maybe the players’
characters need to stop a monster menacing the community.
Maybe they’re trying to uncover a mystical cure to a family
member’s terminal illness. Even when the desired result
is simply uncovering the truth, Clues help the characters
establish and qualify the truth, which may mean the difference between being locked away for claiming the fantastical,
and having hard data which can save lives and change fates.

## Two Essential Rules of Investigation

These two rules are important for maintaining the integrity of investigations in your chronicle. 

## No Hard Answers

Don’t settle on hard answers up front. As Storyteller,
don’t devote too much energy to coming up with all the potential Clues and answers ahead of time. This could put you
in a position where you’re railroading the players, and forcing
them to go along with your plans. Or worse, they could get
frustrated as the puzzle pieces aren’t coming together in a way
they expect. Improvisation is your best tool in investigation.
Let the players have some say in the Clues they establish,
and work with them to bring together the results in a way
that makes sense for everyone. This will give them an investment in the story, and will take some responsibility off your shoulders. It will also help to cater the story to their specific
interests and biases. When they succeed, ask them, “What do
you find?” and let their answers inform the direction of your
story. If you have a culprit in mind, that’s fine. However, let
the players help guide the path to that culprit if at all possible.

## No Binary Rolls

If your chronicle’s integrity or pacing would be negatively
impacted by a failure, don’t let that failure act as binary
stakes in an investigation. In popular fiction, particularly the
kind the Chronicles of Darkness emulate, the protagonists
will generally end up figuring out the mystery. This doesn’t
intuitively map to the success/failure nature of Storytelling
system dice rolls. Play with stakes. Maybe failure at a given
stage means the protagonists still find their Clue, but the
antagonist realizes he’s being pursued. Maybe finding that
Clue takes longer than expected, so the culprit can get away
with another stage of his plan. A good investigation story
needs to maintain momentum, lest it become frustrating.
In this system, Clues offer dice advantages for later rolls.
Failure doesn’t inherently mean the Clue isn’t uncovered; it
just means it can’t offer a dice benefit later. It’s up to you to
determine just why that is. Is the evidence tainted? Is there
a mitigating twist? 

## Frame the Action

Unlike most actions in the Chronicles of Darkness, this
style of extended investigation assumes the characters do a
myriad of things across the course of the effort. It should
never just be a series of rolls; you always want to give as
much context as possible between each step, with each Clue.
This is more than just explaining Clues; you want to space
out the events with action scenes, social scenes, and events
that further the plot and maintain momentum. This serves
two main purposes. First, it mixes up the action and offers
variety. Second, it builds a sense of stakes. If the world turns
while the investigation proceeds, then real things happen and
time is of the essence. Sure, the characters might get closer
to the murderer if they push the investigation forward. But
what about the cultists threatening to tear into the fabric of
reality? A Storytelling game is about choice, and this gives
your players choices of what to engage. 

## What is a Clue?

Clues, in the scope of these rules, are a specialized type
of equipment. However, the existence of a Clue
isn’t always tied to an actual object with which a character
can interact. Sometimes, a Clue is an important fact, or even
a series of well-connected dots. Clues are different from most
equipment in that their advantages are resources which can
be expended. These resources, called elements, can be used
for anything pertaining to that Clue or the investigation at
large. They may help a principle investigator pursue a culprit; they may help in the court room when seeking conviction.
They could even offer valuable insights which could protect
potential victims from the perpetrator. Once fully expended,
a Clue cannot offer its benefits again. 

If the characters aren’t looking to solve a centralized puzzle
with Clues, they can be stockpiled and used at other times.
For example, players may use these investigation rules in order
to dig up blackmail material; each item of blackmail material
would count as one specific Clue, and its elements could be
used as Leverage in a Social Maneuver. Clues can
go above the normal +5 limit on dice bonuses; they’re limited
only by the character’s Investigation Skill. 

Clues are best represented visually at your table. Index
cards are a good place to start, with ticks or glass beads to
represent the available elements on each. This way, players
can see what their characters have to draw from. They can
also be handed from character to character. 

## Relevant Traits

In an investigation, characters may use a variety of game
traits, Attributes, Skills, Merits, and otherwise. This is
particularly important to note, because while characters all
possess an Investigation Skill, many different character types
can benefit an investigation without actually being investigators. For example, lab technicians might assist in uncovering
Clues with Science or Medicine without even a single dot
of the Investigation Skill, and those Clues are very valuable
when handed off to a principle investigator. 

Having a number of specialists with a variety of Skills can
make for a potent series of Clues, with numerous elements
of which to take advantage.

## Investigation

Investigation is still an integral Skill in investigation efforts. It allows characters to tie Clues together, and to utilize
them practically. Characters may only draw from one Clue
in a given action by default, or one Clue for each dot of
Investigation she possesses. 

## Step One: Decide the Scope of the Investigation

First off, you need to determine the full scope of the
investigation. What are the characters ultimately looking
for? What’s their end game? This will often take multiple
Clues before it becomes viable. For most stories, one to
five Clues should be sufficient, where five Clues indicates
a consuming task. If you want the investigation to be the
thrust of an extended chronicle, the target number should
be at least half the number of planned chapters to allow for
deviation in the plot, or up to twice the total number in a
highly-focused chronicle. 

Once characters reach the required number of Clues,
they’re able to Uncover the Truth if that’s their goal. They
can do so without any additional rolls if they spend a number
of Clue elements (divided however they like) equal to the
required Clues for the investigation. See below for more on
Uncovering the Truth.

## Step Two: Determine the Potential Clue

Once the characters go digging for Clues, you have to
determine what they find and what it means. Ask some simple
questions of the player. “Where is she searching?” “What does
she hope to uncover here?” “How does she think he did it?”
Those are just some basic examples. Pay close attention to
the context, and ask questions based on that. Consider what
matters, what the character already knows, and what she
values. Let the player’s answers guide the search for a Clue. 

## Step Three: Establish Interval

Next, you have to determine how long the search takes.
This is governed in part by context, and in part by the needs
of your story. Searching for a Clue is technically an instant
action, but can take a span of time. If the end result of an
investigation is the focus of an extended chronicle, you might
want the players to stretch out their efforts, for example. If
the character is casing a room from which a monster fled,
it might only take a few minutes. If she’s diving to a sunken
ship to find a specific chipped goblet owned by the monster,
that could take an hour or more.

Don’t be afraid to add story framing to the search for
a Clue. In our previous examples, maybe the monster left
behind a dangerous contaminant the characters have to
overcome to case the scene. Or for our wrecked ship, perhaps
the characters have to traverse shark-infested waters to get
where they need to be. If the characters perform particularly
well in these efforts, consider offering bonuses to the effort
to find the Clue. 

You can use out-of-character designations if you want
to string an investigation out over an extended period. For
example, you may allow for one Clue per game session. This
would support a “season arc” like in popular television shows.
Every “episode” the characters can get a little closer to the
final reveal. If the characters uncover the truth faster than
expected, that gives you more time at the end of the arc to
explore the ramifications and implications of the truth. If
they’re moving quickly, you can offer side stories and personal
exploration stories.

## Step Four: Create Dice Pool

By now, you should have an idea of what the character is
doing to establish the Clue. This could mean research, forensics work, interviewing witnesses, or any other action pertaining to the investigation. Establish a dice pool pertaining to
that action. Allow the player some input here; there’s a good
chance she has a dice pool in mind already when determining
her character’s action. Look to the suggested modifiers for
some examples of what might modify this dice pool. 

## Step Five: Uncover the Clue

With the roll, the character uncovers the Clue. 

## Uncovering the Clue

The dice pool depends on how the characters approach
the pursuit. Each time the same Skill is used to uncover
Clues in an investigation, the dice pool suffers a cumulative -1 penalty. A diverse, holistic approach always helps in
investigations. Continuing with the same approach offers
diminishing returns.

**Dice Pool**: Special

**Action**: Instant

**Dramatic Failure**: In addition to imposing a negative
Condition at the Storyteller’s discretion, one Clue from the
investigation gets the Tainted tag.

**Failure**: The character finds a Clue, but it gets the
Incomplete tag.

**Success**: The character has uncovered a Clue. It gets a base
element, plus any additional elements as needed (see below).

**Exceptional Success**: Not only does the character uncover
a Clue with an extra element, she creates a Condition to
benefit the search. Common examples include Informed or Inspired. Don’t be limited to
those, though.

**Suggested Modifiers**: Crime scene over a day old (-1), over
a week old (-3), over a year old (-5), tenacious questioning
(+1), thorough canvassing (+2), personal grudge (-2), relevant
superstitions (+ or – 1 to 3), too emotionally invested (-2),
unrestricted access to the scene (+2), someone tampered with evidence (-1 to -5), crime aligns with investigator’s
Virtue (+1), crime aligns with investigator’s Vice
(-2), lone investigator (-1), rushed for time (-1 to -3)

## Clue Elements

Most Clues start with a single element. Clues
established with an exceptional success gain an additional element. Clues established by specialists
gain an additional element. In this case, specialists are characters who have 4 or more dots in
the relevant Skill, or a Specialty directly relating
to the Clue. A character may only contribute a
given Skill or its Specialties one time in a given
investigation for this purpose. Some Merits or
other variables can influence the number of elements a Clue receives. 

Elements can be spent for +1 to a relevant
dice pool, or as part of the effort to solve the investigation. A character can only spend elements
from one Clue at a time, or Clues equal to her
Investigation dots. She may spend any number
of elements from a Clue, however. 

## Clue Tags

Clues can be tagged, like equipment. These
tags influence how the Clue is used. If you’re using index cards or other visual markers for Clues,
be sure to note any relevant tags. Here are some
examples from the Uncovering Clues mechanics:

## Incomplete

Incomplete Clues are useful, but not quite as
much as others. Their elements may only be used
to grant dice to other rolls to uncover Clues. They
may not add to other rolls or be used as part of
an effort to solve the final investigation. 

## Tainted

Your character has evidence that supports
a strong narrative, but that evidence features
reasonable doubt or potential holes. If a character has access to a Tainted Clue, ignore the
first success on any actions pertaining to the
investigation. Your character may have multiple
instances of this penalty; additional instances are
cumulative. For example, with three instances
of Tainted, you must roll four or more successes
to succeed, or eight to succeed exceptionally.
Any time an element from this Clue applies,
it applies a -2 penalty instead of the normal +1
bonus. The element is removed from the clue
as usual. This reflects the need to work out the
Tainted Clue fully before it no longer hurts the
investigation.

## Uncovering the Truth

Once characters have the requisite Clues, they may
Uncover the Truth. So long as they have the required number
of Clues, this doesn’t require a roll; they have pieced together
the puzzle. However, for every Clue short of the required
total, the Storyteller adds one significant complication to the
investigation. Some example complications are: 

• The culprit has plausible deniability.

• The culprit has a viable escape plan.

• The culprit has a hostage.

• The characters risk legal consequences if they pursue
the culprit.

• The characters risk professional or personal consequences if they pursue the culprit.

• The crime in question was a smokescreen for a greater
conspiracy. 

If possible, use input that came from the players during the investigation to determine the results. This doesn’t
necessarily mean they get to determine the culprit, but they
should be able to influence the finer details. After all, if they
made hypotheses and assumptions during the investigation,
and their efforts were successful, that should mean most of
their theories rang true.
