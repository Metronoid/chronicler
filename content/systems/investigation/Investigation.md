# **Investigation**

Investigating is about uncovering mysteries and gaining Clues to reach a desired outcome. A single dice roll can suffice for brief investigations, but for deeper explorations, the system offers greater depth. The accumulation of Clues benefits future actions and drives the story forward, whether it be solving a monster problem, finding a cure, or uncovering truth. The Clues are crucial in establishing credibility and determining the outcome, which could impact lives and change fates.

## **What is a Clue?**

A Clue is a type of equipment used in investigations. It can be a physical object or an important fact or a series of connected dots. Clues offer resources called elements that can be used in various ways, such as pursuing a culprit or seeking conviction. Once the elements are fully expended, a Clue loses its benefits. If the characters are not working on a puzzle, Clues can be stockpiled for later use, like for obtaining leverage in a social maneuver. Clues have unlimited potential bonuses limited only by the character's Investigation Skill. To keep track of Clues, use index cards with ticks or beads to represent the available elements. This visual representation makes it easier for players to see what their characters have to draw from and to share the Clues among themselves.

## **Relevant Traits in Investigation**

Investigation involves using various game traits, Attributes, Skills, Merits, etc. Characters don't have to have the Investigation Skill to be valuable in an investigation - other Skills, like Science or Medicine, can be used to uncover Clues. The presence of specialists with diverse Skills can lead to a range of powerful Clues.

The Investigation Skill is still important for tying Clues together and using them effectively. Characters can use one Clue per action by default, or one Clue for each dot of Investigation they have.

## **Uncovering the Clue**

To uncover a Clue in an investigation, create a dice pool based on the character's action, such as research, forensics, interviewing witnesses, etc. The player may have input on the dice pool. The Clue's difficulty level is affected by the approach taken and the dice pool will suffer a cumulative -1 penalty each time the same Skill is used. A diverse approach is recommended. The outcome of the roll will determine if the Clue is uncovered and the quality of the Clue. 

A Dramatic Failure may result in a negative Condition and a Tainted Clue.

A Failure may result in an Incomplete Clue.

A Success will result in a base Clue, with additional elements if needed.

An Exceptional Success will result in an extra element and a beneficial Condition. Factors such as crime scene age, questioning technique, emotional investment, evidence tampering, personal beliefs, and more can modify the dice pool.

## **Clue Details**
A Clue usually has one element but can gain more with an exceptional success or if the character has 4 or more dots in the relevant Skill or a related Specialty. Only one Skill or Specialty per investigation can contribute to a Clue's elements. Merits or other factors may also affect the number of elements a Clue has.

Elements can be spent for a +1 bonus to a related dice pool or to advance the investigation. A character can spend elements from only one Clue or the number of Clues equal to her Investigation dots. Any number of elements can be spent from a Clue.

## **Clue Tags**
Clues may have tags that affect their use, such as:

**Incomplete**: These Clues are helpful but not as much as others. Their elements can only be used to grant dice to uncover other Clues, not for other rolls or solving the investigation.

**Tainted**: This Clue supports a strong narrative but has doubts or weaknesses. Ignore the first success in any investigation-related action and apply a -2 penalty instead of the normal +1 bonus. The penalty is cumulative and the element is removed as usual.

## **Uncovering the Truth**
Once the characters have enough Clues, they can uncover the truth without a roll. But for each Clue missing, the Storyteller adds a significant complication to the investigation, such as legal consequences, professional consequences, the culprit having a viable escape plan, etc. The players' input during the investigation should be used to determine the outcome.
