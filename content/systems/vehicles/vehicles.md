# Vehicles

In the Chronicles of Darkness, vehicles serve numerous
functions. Of course, they get people from point A to point
B. This is essential in a horror story, since getting away from
a scare or rushing to protect the endangered are genre staples.
However, for creative characters, they serve as effective weapons against daunting threats, ways to close the gap between
human capability and the supernatural, and as complex tools
to solve complex problems. Characters stranded in the woods
with a broken axle can use an engine block to cook dinner in
a pinch, or to send smoke signals. With just some rope, a car
becomes a towing machine, a way to interrogate a monster,
or an inefficient but highly effective lockpick.

## Vehicle Traits
These rules add specific traits to vehicles, while keeping
them relatively abstract.

**Dice Modifier**: This is the amount subtracted or added
from the driver’s Dexterity + Drive dice pools.

**Size**: This is the general size of the vehicle. Size in the
Storytelling System is an abstract that reflects weight, mass,
bulkiness, and space. Look to the chart on p. 26 for guidelines.

**Durability**: Durability reflects the general toughness of the
materials, and their ability to withstand harm. Any time a vehicle
would take damage, subtract its Durability from the amount
suffered. As a rule, wood, thick glass, or hard plastic offer 1
Durability, stone or aluminum offer 2 Durability, and steel or
iron offer 3 Durability. Additional Durability can be added for reinforced items. Sources of aggravated damage ignore Durability.

**Structure**: Structure is the amount of punishment a vehicle
can take before becoming useless. It’s usually equal to the object’s Size plus Durability. However, weaker or stronger objects
may be lower or higher. An object suffering half its Structure
in damage levies -2 to any rolls to operate it. At three fourths
its Structure in damage, it levies -5 to use. Bashing, lethal, and
aggravated damage are applied equally to Structure. Structure
damage requires repair rolls to fix.

**Speed**: This is the vehicle’s safe Speed. This requires about a
minute of acceleration to reach for many vehicles (or 20 turns in
combat). The fastest sports cars reach this speed in about 15 seconds
(or five turns). Most vehicles can reach one and a half times their
Speed within another minute. However, when operating above normal Speed, apply the vehicle’s default Dice Modifier as an additional
penalty to all rolls. While above normal Speed, all rolls to maneuver
the vehicle that fail are treated as dramatic failures. Additionally,
turning the vehicle more than 45 degrees in a turn while above
normal Speed requires an instant action maneuvering roll to keep
the vehicle stable; failure overturns it and counts as a crash.

As a general rule, most vehicles gain 5 Speed per turn.
Vehicles with the High Acceleration tag gain 10 Speed per
turn. Successes on a Dexterity + Drive roll add 5 Speed to the
normal acceleration. Remember to apply the vehicle’s Dice
Modifier to this roll. Vehicles marked as Slow Acceleration
cannot benefit from rolls to improve acceleration.

*Example: Suzy has a compact car. On the first turn, it has 5
Speed. On the second, it has 10 Speed. Since she’s trying to escape
from a rampaging wendigo, that’s not enough, so she kicks it into
high gear. Her player rolls Dexterity + Drive – 2 (the car’s Dice
Modifier) and gets three successes. That adds another 15 to the Speed,
so it’s now going at 25 Speed. The wendigo runs faster and faster, so
she keeps pushing forward. Once she exceeds 90 Speed, all her rolls
begin suffering -4 instead of -2, since she’s pushing the vehicle past
its safe limit. It’ll go up to a potential 135 Speed if she keeps it up.*

**Modified Vehicles**: With mechanical knowhow, characters can modify vehicles from their base statistics. A vehicle
can support a number of modifications equal to twice the
technician’s Craft dots; each modification requires four
hours’ work to install. If stressed or lacking sufficient tools,
the Storyteller can require an Intelligence + Crafts roll for
each modification. Potential modifications include: 

• +1 Dice Modifier (limit +5)

• +2 dice to a secondary equipment bonus. For example,
a masterful paint job which offers dice to Persuasion
rolls. (limit +4 per bonus)

• +0.5 Size (2 modifications add 1 Size, adds Structure)

• +0.5 Durability (2 modifications add 1 Durability,
limit 5)

• +2 Structure

• +5 Speed

• Remove Slow Acceleration tag from vehicle. (3
modifications)

• Add High Acceleration tag to vehicle. (2 modifications)

## Crashes
When a vehicle hits a character or another vehicle, a crash
occurs. There are two basic scenarios for this rule:

## Vehicle Hitting Light Object
This occurs when a vehicle hits something equal to or less
than half its Size. The light object suffers one tenth the vehicle’s
Speed in bashing damage, plus half its Size (rounded down).
The driver must make a Dexterity + Drive roll, factoring in the
vehicle’s Dice Modifier. Failure means the vehicle takes half the
struck object’s Size plus one tenth its own Speed in damage.
Any damage that exceeds the vehicle’s Durability is also applied to passengers and the driver as bashing damage. Effective
seat belts, air bags, and other safety devices halve this damage.

If the driver is actively trying to strike the light object,
make a Dexterity + Drive roll, penalized by Defense if applicable. Failure means the vehicle fails to hit. Successes are
added to the damage caused to the victim, but not to the
driver and passengers. This does require a second Drive roll,
however, to resist taking damage.

## Vehicle Hitting Heavy Object
This occurs when a vehicle hits something more than half
its Size. Both objects suffer one half the other object’s Size
(rounded down) plus one tenth the relative Speed in damage.
If the two objects are colliding against each other head on or
perpendicularly, add their Speeds together for this. If they’re
moving parallel to each other, subtract the lower Speed from
the higher Speed. If able to react (potentially involving a Wits
+ Composure roll to detect surprise), both drivers
can make Dexterity + Drive rolls. Each success removes two
damage from the amount their vehicle suffers.

Any damage that exceeds an object’s Durability is also
applied as bashing damage to the driver and its passengers.
As above, effective seat belts, air bags, and other safety devices
halve this damage.
