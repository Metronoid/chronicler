# Experience

A player earns Beats for his character in many ways (listed
below). When your character has gained five Beats, they
convert to one Experience, which can be used to develop
your character’s abilities.

## Beats

You gain Beats when your character fulfills one of the
criteria below.

• If your character fulfills an Aspiration, take a Beat. At
the end of the game session, replace the Aspiration.

• Each Condition has criteria for resolution. When
resolving a Condition, take a Beat.

• Some Conditions provide Beats for actions other than
resolution.

• Any time you fail a roll, you may opt to make it a
dramatic failure and take a Beat.

• If your character takes damage in one of her three
rightmost Health boxes, take a Beat.

• At the end of any game session, take a Beat.

• Any time your character risks a breaking point,
take a beat.
