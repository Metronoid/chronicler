# Chases

Chases are a common element of horror stories. Someone
or something chases, and with it comes death or worse. In
most action scenes, a character’s Speed trait determines
how much he can move. This means that generally, you can
figure out who is faster without dice. However, these rules
let you turn the chase into the focus of the scene, and add
granularity and depth to it. 

## Set the Terms

First, determine the terms of the chase. Start with the
initial lead, as well as what it would take for either the pursuer
to catch her prey, or the prey to successfully flee. These traits
reflect the number of successes each party needs to either
escape or catch their quarry. If there are multiple parties
involved, they should each be defined as pursuer or prey for
these purposes.

The base number of successes for a given character to
prevail is five. Modify that with the following variables as
examples, but feel free to make up your own. Use only the
highest modifier for a specific category. Also note that each
character has his own target number here.

Note that this target number can change from turn to
turn. Smart players can manipulate their character’s circumstances in their favor.

If the pursuer achieves the required successes, she reaches
the prey and gets one instant action before moving into
Initiative. If the prey reaches the required successes, he successfully evades his pursuer, and the chase ends. The pursuer
will need to use other methods to rediscover the prey.

## The Edge

In a plain, open space with flat ground and full visibility,
the character with the higher Speed will overcome in a chase.
However, this is rarely the case in the Chronicles of Darkness.
Environments shift. Weather changes. Obstacles pepper the scene. As the context changes from turn to turn, the character
with more ability to maneuver has the Edge, and can temporarily control the flow of the chase. In terms of the narrative,
that character has managed to manipulate the circumstances
of the chase to her advantage. Her player should work with
the Storyteller to determine what that means.

This is usually determined with relative ease. In a crowded
street, a character on foot has better ability to maneuver than
a character in a car. In his cornfield, a farmer has better ability
to maneuver than a mysterious stranger. Often, preparation
can influence this; if you can choose the environment, you
can pick somewhere with an inherent advantage. 

If you can’t easily determine who has the Edge at a given
moment, make a contested roll. Usually, this will be based
on Wits or Dexterity. The relevant Skill should relate to the
context. Often, this will be Athletics, Streetwise, Survival, or
similar. Don’t be limited; let characters lean on their areas
of expertise when possible. In an abandoned factory, a savvy character may be able to maneuver through labyrinthine
machinery with Dexterity + Crafts, for example.

If the context of the scene changes significantly, redetermine who has the Edge. 

## Turn-By-Turn

Chase turns reflect between 30 seconds and a minute
of game time; if you’re running an extended chase that lasts
hours, instead break it up into a series of incidents during
the chase, each represented by its own individual chase.

At the beginning of every turn, the side with the Edge
determines the terms of that turn. At Storyteller discretion,
the side with the Edge determines the dice pool for the chase
that turn, and makes the first roll. This dice pool has to make
sense within the current context of the chase, but the player
should have at least some say in what changes in that turn. As
Storyteller, only veto these choices if they absolutely do not
make sense in the moment. The roll doesn’t have to reflect
direct pursuit or evasion actions, but is identical for both
sides. The roll should have a narrative element, one which
implies potential stakes for failure.

Example: *The player with the Edge determines that this turn,
the dice pool is Wits + Animal Ken. The reasoning behind this is
that the chase has moved into a junkyard full of feral dogs. The roll
reflects the characters’ ability to maneuver around the dogs without
being slowed or worse, attacked.*

If the other side wishes to use other dice pools, they lose
the 10-again quality on his roll, and suffer a cumulative -1
penalty. This penalty increases every time he uses a dice
pool aside from the one dictated. He does not suffer it on
turns where he has the Edge or otherwise uses the dictated
dice pool, but it continues to amass if he decides not to on
a future turn. 

Note that the side with the Edge rolls first; this means if
they hit the required successes, they get their desired outcome
for the chase before the other side makes their roll.

## Pursuit and Evasion 

This is the basic action for pursuit and
evasion in a chase scene.

**Dice Pool**: Special, determined by the side with the
Edge. The Storyteller should
determine relevant bonuses
and penalties based on the
environment.

**Action**: Instant
Dramatic Failure: Your
character suffers the terms
for failure that turn. This
can include the effects
of failure, as well as a
Condition.

**Failure**: Your
character suffers the
terms for failure that turn. You can lose one combined success from your total,
or your character suffers a specific narrative effect such as a
Tilt, two bashing, or one lethal damage. 

**Success**: Your character overcomes the immediate challenge in the chase, and makes headway. Calculate successes,
and add them to your running total.

**Exceptional Success**: In addition to a massive accumulation of successes, your character manages to set back the
opponent. You can subject him to the effects of a failed roll,
regardless of his roll’s outcome. 

## Seizing the Edge

To add a slightly deeper engagement, offer players the choice
to “Seize the Edge” during each turn of the chase. After the
side with the Edge determines the rolls for that turn, both sides
predict their rolled successes that turn, and jot them down. Put
these numbers face down on the table. As the dice are rolled,
uncover those numbers. If a player successfully guesses their
rolled successes, that player gets the Edge during the next turn,
despite dice and circumstance. This rule heavily favors underdogs
because it’s easier to guess successes with fewer dice; it’s a good
option to mix up play if the players are trying to evade something
that would otherwise outclass them. 

## The Social Chase

The chase rules can be used for scenes besides traditional
foot pursuits or car chases. You could use this for tracking
a suspect, for example. Or, you could use this system as an
alternative to Social Maneuvering, which normally reflects attempts to find vulnerabilities and wear down social defenses.
These rules offer a more direct social “chase.” It doesn’t even
require direct modification; you can simply use these rules
with slightly different narrative framing. In a social chase,
the goal is to get a character into a social position where he
has to act in a certain way. Picture a character trying to convince a wealthy patron to financially back her run for Waste
Management Commissioner. Her efforts are all about getting
the patron in the right place at the right time, where he can’t
say no. It means maneuvering into the right venue, when just
the right witnesses are around, and all before he has a chance
to back her rival. Sounds kind of like a chase, doesn’t it?
