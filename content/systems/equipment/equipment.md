# Equipment

Equipment, tools, and technology help to solve problems.
Having the right tool for the job can mean the difference
between life and death, or, in the Chronicles of Darkness,
the difference between life and a fate worse than death. This
list is not all inclusive, but features many of the tools that
characters in the might have at their disposal. 

Equipment is divided up by the Skills with which they typically assist. Mental Equipment typically assists with Mental
Skills, for example. Additionally, Supernatural Equipment
deals with the paranormal, and may not be suitable for every
chronicle. Lastly, Bygones are items that characters cannot
procure easily or recreate. They’re unique items that deal
with the otherworldly.

## Availability and Procurement

The dot cost of a piece of equipment reflects directly on
the Resources cost if your character wishes to purchase it (or
the cost of components, for some things). It also reflects the
level of Allies or other Social Merit required to find the item,
and the Skill level required to procure it with a single dice roll.
For example, if a Party Invitation has Cost •••, a character
with Larceny •• should not be able to find and steal the item
without a dice roll, but a character with Politics •••• might
be able to get one by virtue of saying the right words to the
right organization. If your character wishes to obtain higher
Availability items with their Skills, it requires a deeper effort.

## Size, Durability, and Structure

These are guidelines that represent common, standard
examples of the items in question. For most items, characters
could procure better examples, at a higher Availability rating.

## Dice Bonuses

Most equipment offers a bonus to dice rolls pertaining to
its use. Multiple items can influence a given roll, but a roll
should not receive more than a +5 bonus.

## Game Effect

A character with the item can use these Effects. Any
restrictions, costs, or parameters are listed individually.
