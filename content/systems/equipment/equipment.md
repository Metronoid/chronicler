# Equipment

Equipment, tools, and technology help to solve problems.
Having the right tool for the job can mean the difference
between life and death, or, in the Chronicles of Darkness,
the difference between life and a fate worse than death. This
list is not all inclusive, but features many of the tools that
characters in the might have at their disposal. 

Equipment is divided up by the Skills with which they typically assist. Mental Equipment typically assists with Mental
Skills, for example. Additionally, Supernatural Equipment
deals with the paranormal, and may not be suitable for every
chronicle. Lastly, Bygones are items that characters cannot
procure easily or recreate. They’re unique items that deal
with the otherworldly.

## Availability and Procurement

The dot cost of a piece of equipment reflects directly on
the Resources cost if your character wishes to purchase it (or
the cost of components, for some things). It also reflects the
level of Allies or other Social Merit required to find the item,
and the Skill level required to procure it with a single dice roll.
For example, if a Party Invitation has Cost •••, a character
with Larceny •• should not be able to find and steal the item
without a dice roll, but a character with Politics •••• might
be able to get one by virtue of saying the right words to the
right organization. If your character wishes to obtain higher
Availability items with their Skills, it requires a deeper effort.

## Size, Durability, and Structure

These are guidelines that represent common, standard
examples of the items in question. For most items, characters
could procure better examples, at a higher Availability rating.

## Dice Bonuses

Most equipment offers a bonus to dice rolls pertaining to
its use. Multiple items can influence a given roll, but a roll
should not receive more than a +5 bonus.

## Game Effect

A character with the item can use these Effects. Any
restrictions, costs, or parameters are listed individually. 

## Ranged Weapon Lexicon

**Ranges**: The listed numbers a short/medium/long ranges in yards. Attacks at medium range suffer a −1 penalty. Attacks at
long range suffer a −2 penalty.

**Clip**: The number of rounds a gun can hold. A “+1” indicates that a bullet can be held in the chamber, ready to fire.
Initiative: The penalty taken to Initiative when wielding the gun.
Strength: The minimum Strength needed to use a weapon effectively. A wielder with a lower Strength suffers a −1 penalty
on attack rolls.

**Size**: 1 = Can be fired one-handed; 2 = Must be fired two-handed and can be hidden in a coat; 3 = Can be fired twohanded but not hidden on one’s person
Availability: The cost in Resources dots or level of Social Merit needed to acquire the weapon.


## Melee Weapon Lexicon

**Type**: A weapon’s type is a general classification that can apply to anything your character picks up. A metal club might be
an antique mace, a metal baseball bat, or a hammer, while a hatchet might be a meat cleaver or an antique handaxe.

**Damage**: Indicates the number of bonus successes added to a successful attack. Weapons always deal lethal damage.
Initiative: The penalty taken to Initiative when wielding the weapon. If using more than one weapon, take the higher penalty and increase by 1.
Strength: The minimum Strength needed to use a weapon effectively. A wielder with a lower Strength suffers a −1 penalty
on attack rolls.

**Size**: 1 = Can be hidden in a hand; 2 = Can be hidden in a coat; 3+ = Cannot be hidden.

**Availability**: The cost in Resources dots or level of Social Merit needed to acquire the weapon.

**Concealed**: A character who wields a shield but doesn’t use it to attack can add its Size to his Defense, and uses its Size as
a concealment modifier against ranged attacks.

**Grapple**: Add the chain’s weapon bonus to your dice pool when grappling.

**Stun**: Halve the victim’s Size when aiming for the head with intent to stun.

**Two-handed**: This weapon requires two hands. It can be used one-handed, but doing so increases the Strength requirement
by 1.

## Armor Lexicon

**Rating**: Armor provides protection against normal attacks and Firearms attacks. The number before the slash is for general
armor, while the number after the slash is for ballistic armor.

**Strength**: If your character’s Strength is lower than that required for her armor, reduce her Brawl and Weaponry dice
pools by 1.

**Defense**: The penalty imposed on your character’s Defense when wearing the armor.

**Speed**: The penalty to your character’s Speed for the armor worn.
Availability: The cost in Resources dots or level of Social Merit needed to acquire the armor.

**Coverage**: The areas of a character protected by the armor. Unless an attacker targets a specific unarmored location
(“Specified Targets”), the armor’s protection applies. Wearing a helmet increases the armor’s coverage to include a
character’s head.
