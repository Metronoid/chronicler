# Handcuffs

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 4, Size 1, Structure 4, Availability •

**Effect**: A solid pair of steel handcuffs is made to restrain
even a remarkably strong person. Applying handcuffs to an
unwilling combatant is an additional option in a grapple. Roll
Strength + Brawl - the opponent’s Strength. Success means
the handcuffs are where they need to be.

Breaking out of successfully-applied handcuffs requires a
Strength + Stamina - 4 roll. Each success on the roll reduces
the Structure of the cuffs by 1. Cuffs reduced to 0 Structure
snap open. Each attempt to escape causes one point of bashing damage.

A character may also try to finagle their hands out of the
cuffs. This requires a Dexterity + Athletics - 4 roll. Success
allows for an escape, and causes one point of bashing damage. Failure on this roll causes one point of lethal damage,
as the thumb jerks out of socket.

Attempting to do anything requiring manual dexterity
while cuffed incurs a -4 penalty, or -2 if the hands are cuffed
in front. Witnesses are unlikely to behave favorably around
a cuffed character; Social rolls against strangers incur a -3
penalty.

Many police forces and security companies now prefer
heavy-duty plastic zip ties in place of handcuffs. While they’re
slightly less durable (Durability 3), they incur a -5 penalty from
behind or -3 from the front, because they can be far tighter
on the wrists. They can also be cut free.
