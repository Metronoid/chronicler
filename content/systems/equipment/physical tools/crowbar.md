# Crowbar

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 3, Size 2, Structure 4, Availability â€¢

**Effect**: A crowbar is a curved piece of steel used to pry
open shipping pallets, jammed doors, and other things a
normal person would be incapable of doing by hand. It adds
to any dice rolls used to establish leverage. When prying
things open, it allows your character to ignore two points of
Durability on the lock or barricade. A crowbar can also be
used as a weapon (see p. 268).
