# Firearm Suppressor

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 1, Structure 2, Availability ••

**Effect**: A firearm suppressor is popularly and misleadingly
referred to as a silencer in cinema and other media. It’s a
cylinder placed on the end of a gun barrel that changes and
lightens the sound of a shot. A suppressor delivers many
minor benefits, but offers two noteworthy advantages: shortrange accuracy and concealment.

**Increased Accuracy**: A suppressed firearm travels through
a longer barrel and the muzzle crown evens the expulsion of
hot gasses that can slightly affect trajectory. In game terms,
reduce a suppressed gun’s damage rating by one due to the
bullet’s subsonic flight, but increase the attack dice pool by
two when firing at short range.

**Position Concealer**: The sound changes dramatically, to
the point where many people do not recognize the sound
as that of a gunshot and are often unable to place where
the lower tone came from. The muzzle flash is also reduced
dramatically with a suppressor, helping to conceal a shooter’s
position. A character trying to identify a suppressed shot
must roll Wits + Firearms - 2. Any character searching for the
shooter using the gun’s tells suffers a -2 penalty.
