# Gas Mask

Dice Bonus +5, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 3, Availability ••

**Effect**: A gas mask is a filtration device placed over the
face that defends the wearer against noxious chemicals in the
air. With a working gas mask, a character can stand minor
toxins for as long as he needs, whereas other characters might
take damage over time or require rolls to remain conscious.
Powerful toxins may still require rolls. A gas mask adds five
dice to these rolls.
