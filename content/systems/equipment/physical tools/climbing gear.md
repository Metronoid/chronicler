# Climbing Gear
Dice Bonus +2, Durability 3, Size 2, Structure 2, Availability ••

**Effect**: Climbing gear includes ropes, pulleys, handles,
carabiners, hooks, and other assorted tools for scaling things.
They serve a twofold purpose. First, they add their dice bonus
to the normal Strength + Athletics rolls for climbing. Second,
if properly applied (with a Wits + Athletics roll), they prevent
a character from falling more than 10 feet at a time.
