# Caltrops

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 2, Structure 3, Availability ••

**Effect**: Caltrops are small, pointed pieces of metal,
arranged in such a way that one point is always facing
upward. This makes walking (or driving) through a patch
of caltrops inconvenient and painful. These traits assume
possession of enough caltrops to fill a doorway or other
narrow corridor.

Moving through caltrops causes one point of lethal
damage. Caltrops ignore a point of armor or Durability. To move through safely, a Dexterity + Athletics roll is required
with the caltrops’ dice bonus applied as a penalty to the roll.
A character may only move at half Speed (rounded down)
while moving safely through caltrops.

A character may hide caltrops, although it is difficult. A
Wits + Larceny - 3 roll is required; the caltrops’ dice bonus
does not apply to this roll.
