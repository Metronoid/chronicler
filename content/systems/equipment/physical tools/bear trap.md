# Bear Trap
Dice Bonus +2, Durability 3, Size 2, Structure 5, Availability ••

**Effect**: A bear trap is a large metal contraption that
looks something like a set of deadly jaws. For this reason,
they’re also commonly called jaw traps. When a human
or large animal steps into the bear trap, it snaps shut on
their leg. Due to the serrated edges on the trap, this can
cause massive bleeding or even broken bones.

The jaw trap causes three lethal damage and ignores
two points of armor or Durability. A character trapped
in the jaws can attempt to escape as an instant action.
Doing so requires a Strength + Stamina roll, with the
trap’s dice bonus as a penalty due to the distracting pain
and the strength of the jaws. Failure on this roll causes
another point of lethal damage as the jaw digs in further.
Creatures without opposable thumbs cannot escape this
way and must rip themselves free.

Any rolls to hide a bear trap suffer its dice bonus as
a penalty. They’re difficult to hide due to their awkward
shape and weight.
