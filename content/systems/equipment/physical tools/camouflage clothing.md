# Camouflage Clothing

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 3, Availability ••

**Effect**: Camouflage clothing allows its wearer to blend in
with her surroundings enough for the untrained eye to pass
over her completely. Effective camouflage must be catered
to the environment: greens and browns in the woodlands,
shades of grey in an urban area. Proper camouflage adds its
bonus to rolls to remain unnoticed.
