# Pepper Spray

Die Bonus +1, Durability 2, Size 1, Structure 1, Availability •

**Effect**: Pepper spray is a blend of chemicals (mostly
capsaicin, the “hot” part of a chili pepper) contained in
a small spray can, designed to debilitate threats. Civilians
use these devices in self-defense; police use them to
subdue unruly criminals. Use of pepper spray requires a
Dexterity + Athletics or Dexterity + Firearms roll. Each
yard is a range category, so one yard is short range, two
yards is medium, three yards is long range. An opponent’s
Defense applies, but in normal wind conditions, the die
bonus applies to the roll.

Upon the first attack, the victim suffers the Stun Tilt. An opponent struck suffers a -5 penalty to all
actions. This penalty can be reduced by one for every turn
spent rinsing the eyes with water. Commercial chemicals
designed to clean the eyes will fully remove the penalty
after a turn.
