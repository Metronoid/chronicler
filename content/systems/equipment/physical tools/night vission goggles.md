# Night Vision Goggles

Die Bonus +2, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 1, Availability ••

**Effect**: Night vision goggles amplify low-light conditions, allowing characters to see when they otherwise
could not. A character with night vision goggles does not
suffer penalties for acting blind. Bright lights can render
the wearer temporarily blinded, as if he had a flashlight shone in his eyes.
