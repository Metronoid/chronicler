# Lockpicking Kit

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 2, Structure 2, Availability ••

**Effect**: A lockpicking kit consists of picks, tools, and rods
for manipulating tumblers and opening locks. A good kit contains a wide array of tools for all types of locks, but guarantee intrusion of an analog lock. With such a kit and at least a
dot of Larceny, a character can pick a lock without a roll
if time is not an issue. If time is an issue, the dice bonus
applies to the Dexterity + Larceny rolls. At Availability
•,
a character may procure a portable lockpick. It has Size 1,
Structure 1, and is far more concealable. However, it only
offers a +1 bonus and doesn’t allow for picking without
rolls since the kit realistically may not have the right tools
for a given job.

A lockpicking kit only works on mechanical locks.
Digital locks require more specific hacking and code
prediction. A character may procure a digital lockpick at
Availability •••, but it typically only works on one type
of lock, such as the keycard locks used in hotels. Digital
lockpicks can be Size 2, or Size 1 if crafted as an extension
of a laptop computer or smartphone.
