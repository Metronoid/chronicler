# Stun Gun

No Die Bonus, Durability 2, Size 1, Structure 2, Availability •, ••, or •••

**Effect**: A stun gun is designed to deliver an overwhelming
amount of electricity to an assailant in order to shut down
her muscles and send her to the ground. As a defensive item,
this gives the would-be victim time to run or get help. As an
offensive item, it leaves the victim ready for restraint or worse.
These devices come in two varieties (handheld and
ranged). The handheld model has live leads on the edge of
a handle and can be used as many as 50 times on one battery charge. The ranged model fires small, wired darts up to
15 feet away. While the ranged model has a similar battery
life, it uses a compressed air cartridge that must be replaced
after each shot.

Use of a handheld stun gun requires a Dexterity +
Weaponry roll, penalized by the victim’s Defense. The
ranged model uses Dexterity + Firearms, also penalized by the
victim’s Defense. On a successful hit with either, the victim
takes one point of lethal damage. The successes subtract
from the victim’s next dice pool. With the ranged version,
the darts remain in the victim’s body, adding three successes
automatically each turn. They can be removed with a Strength
+ Stamina roll, with the initial successes penalizing the action. With the handheld version, the attacker can attempt
to maintain the shock, which takes a Strength + Weaponry
roll, penalized by the greater of the opponent’s Strength or
Defense. Once the accumulated successes exceed the victim’s
Size, the victim collapses into neuromuscular incapacitation.
Once the shock ends, this lasts for (10 - victim’s Stamina)
turns.
