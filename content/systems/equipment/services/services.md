## Services
In addition to the equipment, characters
may look for services from other characters. Each has an Availability
rating that works identically to other equipment. They
act as a foundation for what certain levels of Allies, Status,
and other Social Merits might accomplish. Assume most services take a week to procure at the
listed Availability levels. Raise Availability by one to make
procurement take a day instead.

Note that some services could be highly illegal and
are limited in access to appropriate Merits. In many cases,
illegal services only offer negligible dice bonuses. Their real advantage comes from a layer of separation from legal authorities.
