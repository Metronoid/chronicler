# Building Equipment

The reverend’s wife isn’t what she seems. She claims to have
been saved by a miracle, but you know better. You know she isn’t the reverend’s wife at all. Something else took her place. As you
learn more (and wish you hadn’t), you discover that whatever
the monster is, it sends and receives radio signals. You guess
monsters can upgrade to the twenty-first century, too. You think
maybe you can expose it to the congregation if you overload its
receiver with interference. All you have to do is modify that old
walkie talkie set your dad has in his garage. And pray.

## Equipment Types

While many characters can gain access to equipment of
all kinds through purchase, borrowing, blackmail, or theft,
some prefer (or are forced) to make it themselves. In this
context, the word “equipment” refers not only to physical
objects like weapons and tools, but also anything else that
can be created by a character to help him out with an action
he wants to take. If it would offer a bonus to an action, or
would make actions possible that were previously not, it can
likely be considered “equipment.”

Five types of equipment can be built:

• Physical Objects: The most common type of equipment. Most of the items found are physical objects, as are weapons and armor.
Creative works also fall into this category.

• Organizations: A small group of people assembled to
address a particular need. A small cult and a cadre of
bodyguards are good examples. Organizations built
as equipment usually disband after one game session
unless the player purchases them as Merits afterward.

• Repositories: Any collection of research materials and
knowledge sources. A library of books, a database, and
an assortment of security footage all count. A character
doesn’t need to build a repository to benefit from an
already-existing source; this only reflects the activity
of gathering materials for repeated future use. If the
player purchases the Library Merit for a repository she
built, the Merit stacks with the equipment bonus, to
a maximum bonus of five dice.

• Plans: Characters can “build” a plan to orchestrate
a complex encounter with a specific goal involving
multiple people, like a heist, a raid, or a rescue. If
successful, this piece of “equipment” grants its bonus
to everyone involved, but winks out of existence as
soon as the plan definitively succeeds or fails. The
Storyteller shouldn’t force the players to come up with
every little detail of the plan abstraction is what the
dice are for though if the players are gung ho about
the particulars, that’s fine too.

• Mystical Equipment: Anything that carries minor
supernatural potency, such as a circle of protection
using salt and bone, a protective amulet, or a werewolf
trap made of silver, counts as mystical equipment. For
more rules about using a spirit’s bane in wards and
other rituals.

## To Roll or Not to Roll

Building equipment should never take more
than the time between one scene and the next. If it
can’t reasonably be built in a few hours or less, the
character needs to acquire it another way. This system isn’t meant to cover building a car from scratch
or getting an entire business off the ground — it’s for
creating solutions to immediate problems. Building
truly supernatural relics is beyond the capabilities
of characters presented in this book.

If the character has plenty of time, isn’t under
any duress, and has dots in the relevant Skill equal
to the equipment bonus a standard example of the
equipment would provide, no roll is necessary. The
Storyteller simply determines how long it should
take and it’s done, either with some roleplay within
a scene, or it’s stated to have happened between
scenes.

However, if the character is under pressure to get
the job done before that werewolf picks up her scent,
or while she’s under attack by enormous slavering
spiders, the player needs to roll. Likewise, if she’s
trying to build something that’s beyond her casual
expertise (i.e., something with an equipment bonus
greater than her dots in the relevant Skill, or some thing the Storyteller determines is too complex to be
made without a roll) then the dice come out. The
Storyteller may also call for a roll if the player wants
to build a more impressive version of the equipment
that has higher traits than the standard example.

## The Build Equipment Action

The type of equipment the character builds
determines which dice pool to use. Most physical
objects use Wits + Crafts, or Wits + Expression for
creative works; organizations may use Presence or
Manipulation + Socialize or Streetwise; repositories
usually use Intelligence + Academics; and mystical
equipment usually uses Wits + Occult. Plans are
a slightly different animal, and require a Wits +
Composure roll. The Storyteller or player can suggest alternatives if appropriate.

The Build Equipment roll always takes a penalty
equal to the intended equipment bonus. When
the equipment is meant to grant other benefits,
like a new function, an increased trait, or access to
a resource, each benefit counts as a one-die bonus
for this purpose, as well as to determine whether
a player needs to roll in the first place. Weapons
impose a penalty equal to their weapon modifier,
and armor imposes a penalty equal to its highest
armor rating (general or ballistic). As usual, this
penalty can’t exceed -5.

The Storyteller may require the use of Resources,
Contacts, or other Merits, or a separate research action,
to reflect putting effort into securing the right materials,
contacting the right person, or having enough specialized
knowledge to build the thing to begin with. This should
only apply when the character wants to build something
particularly complex or potent and it would enhance the
drama of the story to do so. The Storyteller shouldn’t use
this as a hoop the player must jump through, but rather as
a way of introducing interesting plot elements to an action.
However, when it comes to mystical equipment, these rules
don’t replace the need to discover a creature’s bane first; the
best a player can do is an equipment bonus or minor benefit
without that information

**Dice Pool**: Varies\
**Action**: Instant (Special)

While the Build Equipment action is instant and thus
requires only one roll and one success, the actual game time
that passes can range from a few minutes to a few hours. It’s
up to the Storyteller how long it takes, though in most cases
the measurement of in-game time doesn’t matter much —
the only important considerations are whether the action
is finished before something else happens or not, and how
many other people’s actions occur in the interim.

If a Build action occurs during an action scene, the number of turns it takes to complete is equal to the penalty the
roll takes for the equipment bonus and benefits, although it
still only requires one roll. Some Build actions are impossible
during action scenes, like convincing a room full of people
to join a character in peaceful protest, or gathering articles
for a research database. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of
whether a Build action can be completed during an action
scene or not.

## Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure**: The character fails outright, and suffers some negative consequence. It could be taking damage
from an explosive reaction, gaining a negative Condition
like Embarrassing Secret or Leveraged, or leading a supernatural threat directly to the character’s location. The
Storyteller should devise a consequence appropriate to the
circumstances.

**Failure**: The character successfully builds the equipment,
but it carries the Fragile or Volatile Condition (see below).

**Success**: The character successfully builds the equipment
and anyone can use it as normal.

**Exceptional Success**: The player may choose to add one
bonus die or one other benefit to the equipment. Equipment
bonuses still may not exceed +5.

## Equipment Conditions

Unlike most Conditions, these follow the equipment
itself. Any character using the flawed equipment suffers this
Condition until resolved. The Storyteller and player should
work together to decide whether Fragile or Volatile is more
appropriate to the equipment in question. Generally, organizations, plans, and ephemeral mystical equipment like warding circles are better suited to Volatile since they cease
to exist soon after they’re created anyway, while other types
can go either way.

<Card>
## Fragile

The equipment the character is using to aid his action won’t
last long for some reason, whether because it’s an object put together with duct tape and bubble gum, or because his relationship
with the people involved sours, or because his computer ends up
suffering a blue screen of death and the data is corrupted. A plan
may be Fragile because of disrupted communication between the
characters, or because of an unexpected hurdle, etc. The equipment ceases to exist in any usable form after a number of uses
equal to its creator’s dots in the Skill used to build it.

**Possible Sources**: Achieving a failure on a Build
Equipment roll.\
**Resolution**: The equipment falls apart one way or another. Plans grant one Beat to each player whose character
is involved when this Condition resolves.\
**Beat**: N/A
</Card>

<Card>
## Volatile

The equipment the character is using to aid his action is
ready to blow at any moment, figuratively or literally. One
wrong word, one badly-placed rune, and it’s time to duck and
cover. A plan may be Volatile because it backfires terribly,
or because a Storyteller character betrays the group, etc. Any
failure achieved while benefiting from the equipment is automatically a dramatic failure. The equipment may continue to
exist after this Condition is resolved, but if so, its equipment
bonus is reduced by two dice. This can create equipment
penalties if the original bonus was fewer than two dice

**Possible Sources**: Achieving a failure on a Build Equipment roll.\
**Resolution**: The character suffers a dramatic failure while
using the equipment. Plans grant one Beat to each player
whose character is involved when this Condition resolves.\
**Beat**: N/A
</Card>

## Jury Rigging

When you’re dangling from a grappling hook 30 feet
above the cold concrete with an angry mob of gunmen on
your tail, you don’t have the luxury of time. That Molotov
cocktail you’re mixing gets done now or never. That’s where
jury rigging comes in.

**Dice Pool**: Varies\
**Action**: Instant

Use the same dice pool you would use to build the equipment normally. A Jury Rigging action is a normal instant
action that cuts out all the rest of the game time that Build
Equipment usually takes. Every failure while Jury Rigging is
a dramatic failure.

The Storyteller may rule that some equipment is too
complex to be Jury Rigged.

## Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure**: The character fails outright, and suffers some negative consequence. It could be taking damage
from an explosive reaction, gaining a negative Condition like
Embarrassing Secret or Leveraged, or leading a supernatural
threat directly to the character’s location. The Storyteller
should devise a consequence appropriate to the circumstances, although in some cases, the natural consequence of
the character failing to get himself out of a pinch is enough.

**Failure**: As dramatic failure.

**Success**: The character successfully builds the equipment,
but it carries the Fragile or Volatile Condition (see above).

**Exceptional Success**: The character successfully builds
the equipment and anyone can use it as normal.

## Repair, Modifications, and Upgrades

A character may want to fix or alter a piece of equipment that already exists. These actions usually only apply to
physical objects, though exceptions are possible. Doing so
constitutes making a Build Equipment roll as usual, but the
penalty applied equals the difference between the object’s current state and the bonus or benefits the player wants to add.
Broken objects are considered to have an equipment bonus
of 0. Partially-functional objects may have a bonus only one
or two dice lower than their usual bonus. So for instance, if
a computer would normally grant a +2 to research rolls but
won’t start and is therefore currently at a 0, the roll to repair
it would suffer a -2.

To modify or upgrade an object by increasing its traits or
giving it new functions, simply treat each modification as a
+1 equivalent. A character can replace one function with another at no penalty — for instance, reversing the function of a
walkie talkie to cause interference instead of receiving signals.
Modifying vehicles is beyond the scope of these rules
and uses a different system.

## Taking Your Time

A player may choose to build equipment as an extended
action rather than making the usual single roll, taking no
built-in penalty to any of the rolls. Instead, the target number
of required successes equals the total intended bonus and
benefits of the equipment + one. Typically, players do this to
avoid taking large penalties for complex equipment, or when
they have small dice pools to begin with and don’t want to
risk a chance die. The Storyteller determines the time between
rolls as usual. Overall success and failure work as normal for
the Build Equipment action.

The Storyteller may also allow a player to build equipment that normally lies beyond the scope of this system,
such as a car or a business, with an extended action. In this
case, the time between rolls and total successes required
should match the effort involved. Building a car may take
a week between rolls and require 15 total successes, for
example. Storytellers should keep in mind, however, that
it’s usually much easier to acquire such equipment in other
ways, like stealing or purchasing a car, or using Social
Maneuvering to convince a potential business partner to
take the bait. As a result, building this kind of equipment
with extended actions should only be done if the player
really wants to make it from scratch.

## Examples of Play
Meghan plays Cassidy, who’s trapped in a warehouse with
something that has huge teeth and red eyes. She stumbles
across a crate filled with office supplies, and Meghan declares
that Cassidy wants to jury rig a makeshift chain weapon using rubber bands and staplers. Since the chain has a weapon
modifier of +1, the
Build Equipment roll takes a one-die penalty. Cassidy has
Wits 3 and Crafts 2, so Meghan rolls four dice for the Build
action and achieves one success. The Storyteller decides that
the newly-built “chain” has the Fragile Condition and will
therefore fall apart after just two uses. On Cassidy’s next
turn, she successfully uses the weapon to grapple the creature, and keeps it pinned with the chain while she smashes
a window to get out. Unfortunately, after one more turn of
the creature’s struggles against the chain, the rubber bands
snap and the creature chases Cassidy out of the warehouse
and down the street. Meghan earns a Beat for resolving the
Fragile Condition.

A Storyteller character has been captured by a crime lord,
and the player characters make plans to rescue him. They
decide to build a plan as equipment to help them out, and
the Storyteller rules that they must roll, since they only have
two hours before the crime lord makes his move. The players describe a general idea of the plan, with a part for each
character to play in the rescue, and the Storyteller decides the
plan makes good sense and will grant a +2 to everyone’s rolls
in execution. The character with the best Wits + Composure
pool is the primary actor, and everyone else contributes with
teamwork. The Build Equipment roll takes a two-die penalty
and, with five dice left over, fails to produce any successes. The
Storyteller and players agree that the plan carries the Volatile
Condition, and the rescue proceeds as planned. During the
rescue scene, one of the players fails a roll to sneak past a
guard despite using the plan’s two-die equipment bonus, and
it automatically becomes a dramatic failure. This resolves the
Condition and causes the guard to sound an alarm throughout the crime lord’s mansion. The players each gain a Beat
for Volatile’s resolution, and the player who failed her roll
gains another for the dramatic failure. The “equipment” that
was the plan is now done for, and the players must improvise
to face the new complication.
