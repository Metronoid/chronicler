**Effect**: This represents a wad of cash, a briefcase of money,
an offshore bank account number, or some other lump sum. It
can’t be reflected in the Resources Merit since it’s not a regular
income. However, it can be expended to offer a bonus equivalent to its Availability on any social roll where a bribe could be
beneficial. Also, it can be expended to purchase one item of equal Availability. For more complex uses, consider it a single
month’s allotment of the same Resources.
