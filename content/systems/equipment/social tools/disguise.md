# Disguise

Dice Bonus +1 to +3, Durability 1, Size 3, Structure 2, Availability • to •••

**Effect**: A good disguise goes a long way to help fit in with
a strange group, or to go unnoticed in a crowd where one
doesn’t belong. Properly costumed for a situation, no rolls
are required to blend into the crowd. Any rolls to actively
detect the outsider suffer a penalty equal to the dice bonus
of the disguise; the disguised character also gains the bonus
to remain hidden.

With a disguise, a character can emulate the first dot of a
single Social Merit that would make sense within the scope
of the scene. For example, it doesn’t make money appear
from thin air, but it would allow a character to get their
drinks on a nonexistent tab, reflecting Resources •. This
requires a Composure + Subterfuge roll to maintain in the
face of anyone in the know, contested by the witness’s Wits
+ Subterfuge. The dice bonus of the disguise applies to the
liar, but does not affect the witness.
