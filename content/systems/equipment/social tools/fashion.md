# Fashion

Dice Bonus +1 to +3, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 1, Availability • to •••••

**Effect**: Never underestimate the value of high fashion.
Like a disguise, fashionable clothing allows a character to fit
in. However, the point of fashion is to draw attention, not
to fade into the crowd. As opposed to anonymity, fashion
means being noticed. Note that the clothing chosen must
be appropriate to the setting. Punk chic will not work at a
Senator’s fundraiser, for example. When improperly dressed,
the dice bonus applies as a penalty to all Social Skill rolls.
The dice bonus for Fashion is equal to half the Availability,
rounded up.
