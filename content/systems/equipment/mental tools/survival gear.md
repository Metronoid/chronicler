**Effect**: Survival gear is the catch-all term for the various
kits of equipment needed to survive in harsh environments.
This could include tents, canned foodstuff, raingear, sleeping
bags, sterile water, or any of the various things a person can
use to survive the world outside their cushy homes. They
come in two levels: a basic level and an advanced level. The
basic level offers +1 and subtracts one from the effective
level of environment,
while the advanced offers +2 and subtracts two from the effective environment level. This does not help with a Level 4
environment. A resourceful character can rig or scavenge the
necessary supplies for basic survival gear, but an advanced
set of gear requires very specialized equipment. Basic survival
gear can assist with almost any environment, but advanced
survival gear must target one particular type of environment.
