# Cache

Die Bonus +1 to +3, Durability 2, Size 1-5, Structure 5, Availability • to •••

**Effect**: A cache is a hidden and defensible place
for items, usually weapons. It keeps important items
from prying eyes. A cache can never be more
than half the Size of its parent object.
For example, a Size 6 car can
support no larger than a
Size 3 cache. A given
cache can hold two
items of its Size and
any reasonable number of smaller-sized
items. Its Availability
determines its dice bonus, which both adds
to concealment rolls
and subtracts from
rolls to find the items
within.
