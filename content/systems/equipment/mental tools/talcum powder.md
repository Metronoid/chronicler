# Talcum Powder

Dice Bonus +2, Durability N/A, Size 1, Structure N/A, Availability •

**Effect**: Talcum powder can keep a baby’s bottom from
getting diaper rash, but it can also show the presence of the
unseen, and show evidence of intrusion if placed at a portal
of entry. If an area is dusted with talcum powder, a character
must achieve five successes on a Dexterity + Stealth roll to
enter without a trace. Fewer successes will only obscure the
specifics of their feet and hands. Some paranormal investigators use talcum powder as a way to give ghosts and other
invisible entities a method for communication.
