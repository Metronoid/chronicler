# Special Effects

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 5, Structure 3, Availability •••

**Effect**: “Special effects” is a catch-all term for the tricks
and chicanery used by amusement parks and stage magicians
to fool witnesses. A character may use these as a distraction
or a defense. For example, the Pepper’s Ghost illusion is
relatively easy to set up with the right tools. It uses a large
mirror and a sheet of glass, along with a model and a light
source. It projects an illusion of the model’s reflection, and
makes witnesses see a “ghost.”

In addition to the dice bonus, special effects generally fool
their audience at first. A witness will fall for the trick unless
given good reason to be suspicious. This can waste valuable
time or lead the witness into a trap.
