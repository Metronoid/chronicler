# Surveillance Equipment

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 2, Structure 2, Availability •••

**Effect**: Standard surveillance equipment usually consists
of motion detectors, cameras, and monitors. High-end
versions may include infrared heat sensors, barometric scanners, or even more complex gear. Either way, the point of
surveillance equipment is to survey, detect, and otherwise
track who enters or leaves a location. Often, this also means
locking down breached zones. Unless someone knows
surveillance equipment exists and actively avoids it, his presence is noticed and recorded. If he tries to avoid it, contest
his Dexterity + Stealth against the installing technician’s
Intelligence + Computer or Intelligence + Crafts (for digital
and analog systems, respectively). The technician may add
the equipment’s dice bonus. If the intruder scores more successes, he remains unnoticed. Otherwise, he goes on record.
