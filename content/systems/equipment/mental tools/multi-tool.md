# Multi-Tool

Die Bonus +1, Durability 3, Size 1, Structure 4, Availability •

**Effect**: Sometimes the need for mobility doesn’t allow for
your character to carry around a full tool kit. In these cases, a
multi-tool can be a lifesaver. From sawing to stripping wires,
to opening bottles, to filing off serial numbers, a multi-tool
can do the job in a pinch. The multi-tool offers a negligible
die bonus on numerous Crafts and other assorted tasks,
and most importantly, allows for rolls when sometimes they
couldn’t be made for lack of proper equipment. While not made for use as a weapon, it can serve as one, causing zero
lethal damage, but suffering a -1 penalty to hit.
