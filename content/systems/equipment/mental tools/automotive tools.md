**Effect**: Automotive tools are a necessity for all but the simplest automobile repairs. Even then, a fully-stocked garage with
heavy equipment is required for more involved tasks such as
engine or transmission replacement. If time is not a factor, any
trained character with a Crafts Automotive Specialty can repair a
vehicle’s mundane issues without rolls. Complex modifications
and enhancements, or massive damages, always require a greater
effort (an extended Intelligence + Crafts roll) to work out.
