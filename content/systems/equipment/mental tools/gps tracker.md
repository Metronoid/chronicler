# GPS Tracker

Dice Bonus +3, Durability 2, Size 2, Structure 2, Availability ••

**Effect**: With the advent of the modern cellular phone,
most modern people have a GPS-enabled device on their person at any given time. With a bit of know-how and access to
someone’s phone, your character can track their every move
(provided those moves are not in caves, tunnels, or sewer
systems). Some characters will trade GPS data in case one
member of the group becomes lost or if they have to follow
someone without notice. Planting a phone on an unwitting
subject can serve as a highly-effective tracking device.
