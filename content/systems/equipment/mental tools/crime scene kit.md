# Crime Scene Kit

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 2, Size 3, Structure 2, Availability ••

**Effect**: A crime scene (or CSI) kit is a toolbox full of
investigative aids such as magnifiers, fingerprinting dust,
cameras, tape, testing chemicals, and sample bags. While
the kits offer a dice bonus to Investigation rolls, the more
important benefit of the CSI kit is that it allows evidence
to be moved and digested elsewhere. Properly applied, it
allows investigators to do the bulk of their work offsite and
at their own pace.
