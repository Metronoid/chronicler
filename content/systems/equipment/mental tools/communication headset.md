# Communications Headset

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 0, Size 1, Structure 1, Availability ••

**Effect**: Communications headsets keep characters
in constant contact. Different varieties work over different
distances, but most commercial models work over about 200
feet. A common alternative is a conference call between cellular phones and Bluetooth headsets. If the users have practiced
using their headsets together, they gain the dice bonus on
any coordinated efforts. In the case of a teamwork action,
the dice bonus only applies to the final roll. If the users are
unpracticed, the bonus falls to +1 and actors must make
reflexive Wits + Composure rolls to participate successfully.
Any heavy objects can obstruct a headset’s signal. Anything
obstructing with Durability higher than 3 requires listeners to
make a Wits + Composure roll to understand shared messages.
Levy a -1 penalty for each point of Durability over 4.
