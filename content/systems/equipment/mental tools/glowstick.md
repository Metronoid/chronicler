**Effect**: Glowsticks use a chemical mixture to summon
forth enough light to see in a small area. Most commercial
glowsticks last a couple of hours; police and other professional
varieties can last 12. Because they’re small, airtight containers,
they serve the added benefit of being useful underwater or
in the rain. Functionally, they work the same as a flashlight.
However, they cannot be used to blind a target, since their soft
glow is far less obtrusive than a flashlight’s beam. They’re also
very conveniently worn, which can serve strategic purposes
for a group operating in low-light conditions. A member will not go missing without being noticed so long as they have a
glowing neon bar on their belt.
