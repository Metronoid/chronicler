# Flashlight
Die Bonus +1, Durability 2, Size 1, Structure 3, Availability •

**Effect**: In a dark world, a flashlight can be a person’s
best friend. It generally does what it’s supposed to; it helps
cut a path through the unknown. Its die bonus subtracts
from any penalties due to darkness, and adds to any rolls to
search in the dark. A good flashlight can serve as a club in a
pinch. Also, it can blind an unfortunate subject. A Dexterity
+ Athletics roll, subtracting an informed opponent’s Defense,
will put the beam where it needs to be. The victim’s player
may make a contested Stamina roll. If your character scores
more successes than the subject, they’re blinded for one turn.
Victims with especially acute senses are blinded for two turns.
