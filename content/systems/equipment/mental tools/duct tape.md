# Duct Tape
Die Bonus +1, Durability 1, Size 1, Structure 2, Availability •

**Effect**: Duct tape has as many uses as one can think of,
and just as many you never would. It can reinforce barricades,
stabilize weapon handles, bind prisoners, repair broken pipes,
and so much more. In most cases, duct tape can offer a +1
bonus to Crafts-related rolls. Alternatively, it can add a point
of Durability to almost anything. If used as a restraint, rolls
to break free suffer a -3 penalty, and must overcome the duct
tape’s Structure.
