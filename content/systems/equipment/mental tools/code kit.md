# Code Kit

Dice Bonus +5, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 1, Availability â€¢

**Effect**: A code kit is a series of tools created for the
purpose of making and interpreting a code for a specific
audience. A common example is a book code, where a page,
paragraph, and word from a certain book are used as the
foundation for a cypher. This keeps any uninformed eyes off
the intended message. In the case of a book code, a book is
often chosen that all message recipients can access easily. This
guarantees that the code never has to travel with the code key.
A successfully-designed cypher is difficult to break. The
dice bonus acts as a penalty to any rolls to crack the code
without the necessary reference key.
