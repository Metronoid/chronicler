# Luminol

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 0, Size 1, Structure 1, Availability •

**Effect**: Luminol is a chemical that reacts to certain metals
in human blood and other bodily fluids. The reaction causes
a faint neon glow for about thirty seconds, visible in the dark.
It comes in an aerosol can and will seek out faint traces of
bodily fluids, even after a thorough cleaning. In addition to
showing the exact locations of violent crimes, luminol can
assist in tracking wounded people and animals. Luminol’s
dice bonus applies to any roll to track by the fluid traces, or
to piece together the details of a crime scene.
