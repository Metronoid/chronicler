First-Aid Kit

Die Bonus 0 or +1, Durability 1, Size 2, Structure 3, Availability • or ••

**Effect**: A first-aid kit contains all the necessary supplies to
stabilize an injury and stop wounds from getting worse until
the victim can find proper treatment. The one-dot version of
the first-aid kit does not offer a die bonus; it simply allows
for treatment. The two-dot version offers a +1 to treatment
rolls due to superior supplies.
