# Ultraviolet Ink

Dice Bonus +2, Durability 1, Size 1, Structure 2, Availability •

**Effect**: Ultraviolet ink, or invisible ink, as it’s commonly
called, is an outstanding way to relay messages in plain sight.
Since the naked eye cannot perceive the ink without an
ultraviolet light, a character can scrawl messages for other
recipients who are in the know. It also allows for secret information to be passed around through mundane channels. If
someone’s being surveyed by nefarious forces, an ultraviolet message scribbled on a throwaway magazine is much easier
to get into their home unmolested than, say, a suspicious
letter slid through their doorframe. If you need to mark
a path to a secret hiding place, what better way to conceal
the guiding marks?
