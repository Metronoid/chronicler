# Cracking Software

**Effect**: Crappy software’s a dime a dozen. Good, reliable
cracking software is hard to come by. With solid software, a
hacker can force passwords, breach firewalls, and otherwise
be a nuisance in computer systems. Beyond the dice pool
modification, the benefit such software offers is a sort of
buffer between the hacker and security. Any effort to track
the hacker takes two steps: one to identify the software, then
one to trace it back to the source. Functionally, this means
rolling twice on behalf of the security personnel, with an
opportunity for the hacker to withdraw before detection.
