# Keylogging Software

Dice Bonus +2, Durability N/A, Size N/A, Structure N/A, Availability ••

**Effect**: Keylogging software does exactly one thing: it
logs keystrokes on a computer. This is usually done to record incriminating data or passwords. Usually, keylogging
software is coupled with software to transmit the data once
captured. The challenge for the would-be intruder is installing
the software. Email scams are an unreliable way to get onto
a specific computer, but could fool one member of a large
organization. A thumb drive is very effective, but requires
direct, physical access to the recipient computer. The software’s dice bonus offers an advantage to breach a network
or to find important data.
