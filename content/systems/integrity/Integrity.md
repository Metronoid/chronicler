# **Integrity**
The supernatural world puts immense pressure on a person's composure and mental stability, affecting their self-image, psyche, and soul's health, which is referred to as Integrity.

## **Breaking Points**
A breaking point occurs when a person reaches their limit and experiences psychological stress, and their Integrity is at risk. These breaking points can result from their actions or from witnessing supernatural events. There are three categories of breaking points: violating personal moral code, witnessing traumatic events, or being a victim of a supernatural attack. Breaking points are subjective, and the Storyteller should provide hypothetical situations for the player to determine if they would be considered a breaking point for their character.

## **Determining Breaking Points**
The Storyteller, with input from the player, will determine if an action or event constitutes a breaking point for the character. To determine the impact, the player or Storyteller rolls Resolve + Composure, modified by the character's Integrity rating and any additional circumstances. The total modifier should not exceed +/â€“ five dice.

## **System**
The outcome of the roll will determine the character's reaction to the breaking point. A dramatic failure results in traumatic stress and a loss of Integrity, while a failure or success will result in a loss of Integrity and a temporary condition. An exceptional success results in regaining Willpower.
