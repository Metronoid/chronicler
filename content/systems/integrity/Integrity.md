# Integrity
Human characters encountering the supernatural suffer great strains to their composure, as well as to their very
psyches. The measure of a person’s self-image, her psyche,
and her soul’s health is called Integrity. 

## Breaking Points

A character stands to lose Integrity when she experiences
a breaking point. If the action would cause a character psychological stress, it’s worth considering whether the action
constitutes a breaking point. Note, too, that the character may
experience breaking points that do not stem from his own
actions. Witnessing the gruesome realities of the Chronicles
of Darkness, supernatural or otherwise, can do it, too.

When a character performs certain actions or endures
certain experiences, he might reach a breaking point. A breaking point simply means that what a character has done
or seen has outstripped his ability to rationalize or handle it.

A breaking point can fall into one of the following
categories:

• The character performs an action that either violates
his personal moral code or that is considered unacceptable in society.

• The character witnesses something traumatic, terrifying, or that rattles his understanding of the world.

• The character is the victim of a supernatural attack,
whether physical, emotional, or mental.

Breaking points are somewhat subjective, obviously. A
homicide detective with 30 years of experience seeing dead
bodies and hearing confessions of killers has a somewhat higher
tolerance for human depravity than a sheltered 20-something
in a middle-class liberal arts college. During character creation,
it is advisable for the Storyteller to come up with several hypothetical situations so that the player can determine if, in her
judgment, those situations would be breaking points. 

Note that a breaking point is not necessarily something
that the character considers wrong. A character might kill
someone in a clear-cut, unambiguous case of self-defense, but
the experience is probably still a breaking point, even if the
player (and the character) feels the act was entirely justified.
Actions take a toll on the psyche, regardless of whether the
actions were righteous.

## Determining a Breaking Point

The Storyteller should determine whether a given action
or occurrence counts as a breaking point for a character. If
the character is player-controlled, then obviously the player
should have some input into this process 

## System

When a character experiences a breaking point, the player
or Storyteller rolls Resolve + Composure with a modifier
based on the character’s Integrity rating:

**Current Rating Modifiers**
<table class="table-auto">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Integrity</th>
      <th>Modifier</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>8-10</td>
      <td>+2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7-6</td>
      <td>+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5-4</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3-2</td>
      <td>-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1-2</td>
      <td>-2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The Storyteller can also impose modifiers based on how heinous the breaking point is, relative to the character’s experience.
The chart below gives some suggestions, but again, the Storyteller
and the player are encouraged to develop the character’s moral
framework and life experience to the point that modifiers can be customized. Modifiers are cumulative, but the total modifier
from circumstances should not exceed +/– five dice.

## Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure**: The character’s worldview has been
damaged, perhaps beyond repair. The character suffers from
traumatic stress. Lose a dot of Integrity and choose from the
following Conditions (or create a new one with Storyteller
approval): Broken, Fugue, or Madness. Also, take a Beat.

**Failure**: The character’s worldview has been shaken and he
probably questions his sense of self, his ability to relate to people,
his own moral worth, or his sanity. Lose a dot of Integrity and
choose one of the following Conditions (or create a new one
with Storyteller approval): Guilty, Shaken, or Spooked.

**Success**: The character has come through the breaking point intact. He might feel guilty or upset about what
happened, but he can cope. Choose one of the following
Conditions (or create a new one with Storyteller approval):
Guilty, Shaken, or Spooked.

**Exceptional Success**: The character somehow manages to
not only survive the breaking point but to also find meaning
in it, to reaffirm his own self-worth, or to pass through fire and be tempered by it. The character takes a Beat
and regains a point of Willpower.

## Meditation

A character can improve her chances of resisting
a breaking point by meditating. Meditation is an
extended action with a pool of Composure + Wits,
target successes of 4, and an interval of 30 minutes.
After successfully meditating, the character gets a
+1 bonus to her next breaking point roll. Once this
bonus is used or the character sleeps, it disappears,
and must be regained by meditating again.

Soothing music or relaxation tapes can provide a
+1 to +2 equipment bonus. A dedicated meditation
room, perhaps in the character’s Safe Place, provides
+3. Loud noises, an uncomfortable environment, or
lack of sleep inflict a -1 penalty each. Lack of food
inflicts a -1 to -3 penalty.
