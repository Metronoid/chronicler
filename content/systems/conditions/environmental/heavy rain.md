# **Heavy Rain**
**Sources**: Inflicted

**Description**: Torrential rain lashes down in knives,
bouncing high off the sidewalk. The sound of rain on
the ground is a constant hammering rumble that goes on
without end, like dropping ball bearings on a tin roof.
Thick gray curtains of water obscure vision.

**Effect**: Heavy rains — approaching tropical storm levels
or worse — cause a Perception penalty of -3 dice to both
vision and hearing. Rain’s hard to see through, but it’s also
loud. If the rains carry on for an hour or more, the Flooded
Condition will soon follow. This Condition is often accompanied by
Heavy Winds; a character trapped out in Heavy Rains might
come under the effects of Extreme Cold.

**Resolution**: The best way out of the rain is to get
indoors. Unless it’s the start of some sodden apocalypse,
the characters can wait for the weather to ease.
