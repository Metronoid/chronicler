# Ice 

**Description**: The ground’s covered in a mirror-smooth
layer of ice that sends wheels spinning and people’s feet flying
out from under them. The ice can be so thin as to be nearly
invisible, or it can be a thick layer that’s the only thing keeping the characters from sinking into a frozen lake.

**Effect**: When a character can’t trust her footing, divide
her Speed in half, and all Physical rolls (and Defense) suffer
a -2 penalty. Attempting to move at full Speed increases the
Physical penalty to -4. Any dramatic failure on a Physical
roll inflicts the Knocked Down Condition. Driving on ice is a real
pain; halve Acceleration, and characters suffer a -5 penalty
to Drive rolls.

**Causing the Condition**: This Condition doesn’t just apply to icy conditions, but to any surface that’s slick and slippery, including a
spill of industrial lubricant or just a well-polished wooden or
linoleum floor. Characters can use a Dexterity + Crafts roll
to cover an area in industrial cleaner or mix up chemicals
into a lubricant. If the Extreme Cold Condition is in effect, even
covering the area with water will do the trick.

**Ending the Condition**: “Get off the ice” is good advice, but that
can take work. Characters can use heat or fire to melt ice,
or throw down copious quantities of salt or grit to increase
traction.
