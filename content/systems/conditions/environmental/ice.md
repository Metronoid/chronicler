# **Ice** 
**Sources**: Inflicted

**Description**: The ground’s covered in a mirror-smooth
layer of ice that sends wheels spinning and people’s feet flying
out from under them. The ice can be so thin as to be nearly
invisible, or it can be a thick layer that’s the only thing keeping the characters from sinking into a frozen lake.

**Effect**: When a character can’t trust her footing, divide
her Speed in half, and all Physical rolls (and Defense) suffer
a -2 penalty. Attempting to move at full Speed increases the
Physical penalty to -4. Any dramatic failure on a Physical
roll inflicts the Knocked Down Condition. Driving on ice is a real
pain; halve Acceleration, and characters suffer a -5 penalty
to Drive rolls.

**Resolution**: “Get off the ice” is good advice, but that
can take work. Characters can use heat or fire to melt ice,
or throw down copious quantities of salt or grit to increase
traction.
