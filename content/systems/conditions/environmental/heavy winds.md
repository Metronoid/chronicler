# Heavy Winds 

**Description**: Howling winds buffet at the characters,
whipping street furniture into the air and tearing the roofs
from buildings. Powerful winds can toss cars around like
toys. Anyone out in the winds feels like they’re taking a
beating just walking down the street.

**Effect**: Heavy winds are loud, so characters suffer a -3
modifier to aural Perception rolls. Also, the wind inflicts a
penalty to all Physical rolls when out in the winds, including Drive rolls. Grade the wind from one to five; one is
tropical-storm level (around 40 MPH), three is hurricane
level (around 80 MPH), and five is tornado level (150+
MPH). The wind’s grade represents the penalty applied to
Physical dice rolls. Characters outside in the maelstrom
also take damage from flying debris, taking bashing damage each turn equal to the wind’s rating. Characters can
make a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics roll to avoid damage.

**Causing the Condition**: Heavy winds are a fact of life, from
siroccos in the desert, to tornados in the Midwest, to wind
shears everywhere.

**Ending the Condition**: Getting out of the wind is the best way
to end this Condition. Sometimes that’s as easy as sheltering in
an automobile, as long as nobody tries to drive. Buildings
provide more permanent shelter.
