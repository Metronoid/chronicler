# Flooded

**Description**: Some liquid — brackish water, mud, gore,
or raw sewage — has risen enough to impede the character’s
progress.

**Effect**: Each foot of liquid inflicts a -2 penalty to all
Physical dice pools. If the water goes up over her head, the
character has to swim (Dexterity + Athletics), with a penalty
appropriate for the speed of the flooding. Alternatively, she
can try to hold her breath (Stamina + Composure) if she
cannot get her head above the rising waters.

**Causing the Condition**: Normally, this Condition is the result of heavy
rain, sudden snowmelt, or a broken water main. Characters
can cause this Condition by smashing up a water heater, or blowing
up a small dam. Some supernatural creatures may be able to
call floods down onto a region.

**Ending the Condition**: Characters can escape flooding by getting to high ground, which is enough to mitigate this Condition.
A long-term fix would require draining the floodwaters, but
each flood requires its own solution.
