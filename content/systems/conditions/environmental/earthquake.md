# **Earthquake**
**Sources**: Inflicted

**Description**: Everything shudders and shakes, and rents
tear the ground wide open.

**Effect**: Earthquakes don’t last long, but they don’t have to.
When the earthquake’s actually occurring, all Dexterity-based
dice pools (and Defense) suffer a -1 to -5 penalty, depending
on the earthquake’s severity. Characters take between one
and three points of lethal damage per turn of the earthquake’s
duration, though a reflexive Stamina + Athletics roll can
downgrade that damage to bashing — or cancel it entirely on
an exceptional success.

**Resolution**: Earthquakes are, fortunately, very quick
events. It’s very rare for one to last more than a minute (20
turns), so waiting them out is the best course of action
