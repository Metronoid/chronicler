# Informed

**Description**: Your character has a breadth of research information
based on the topic she investigated. 

**Effect**: When you make a roll
relating to the topic, you may resolve this Condition. If the roll
failed, it is instead considered to have a single success. If it
succeeded, the roll is considered an exceptional success. The
roll that benefits from the Informed Condition can be any
relevant Skill roll. For example, a character with Informed
(Werewolves) might gain its benefits when using researched
information to build a silver bear trap with the Crafts Skill.
Combat rolls cannot benefit from this Condition.
