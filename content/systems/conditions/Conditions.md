# Conditions

Conditions represent ways in which the story has
affected a character, and what he can do to move past
those events. Players don’t buy Conditions. Instead,
events in the game apply them and they remain until
certain resolution criteria are met. A character can only
have one instance of a particular Condition unless
each applies to a distinctly different circumstance — for
example, he may be Informed about both the occult
symbol he stayed up all night to research and the inner
workings of the corporation he infiltrated. He’d resolve
each independently.

Characters can gain Conditions as a result of
many events or circumstances. A player can choose
to bring a relevant Condition into play whenever he
rolls an exceptional success. Breaking points can also cause Conditions as the character deals
with the ravages of a harsh and terrifying world.
Spirit Numina, vampiric Disciplines, and other
supernatural powers can inflict Conditions on their
unfortunate victims. Finally, the Storyteller can bring
a Condition into play whenever it would heighten
the drama of the story, or when it would make sense
as the result of a character’s actions.

The listed resolutions for each Condition
are the most common ways to end its effects; other
actions may also resolve it if they would reasonably
cause the Condition’s effects to end. Players should
work with the Storyteller to determine Condition
resolution. When a character resolves a Condition,
the player takes a Beat. However, if a Condition has
a natural time limit and then fades away, he doesn’t
take a Beat — just waiting the Condition out isn’t
enough to resolve it.

Some Conditions are marked as Persistent. These
Conditions typically last for a long time, and can only be
resolved permanently with a specific and impressive effort.
Once per chapter, a player can gain a Beat when a Persistent
Condition impacts his character’s life.

## Condition Sources

Each condition has a source from which it originates, the source depicts the origin of the condition and how it can be resolved.

### Sources
**Damage (type)**: Lethal damage 
**Failure (type)**: Failing a roll
**Success (type)**: Succeeding a roll
**Breaking Point**: Suffering a breaking point
**Supernatural**: Experiencing the supernatural
**Addiction**: Caused by having an addiction
**Natural**: These happen naturally over time

## Obtaining beats
Each condition has a chance to give you a beat when it causes you to fail a roll

## Resolving Conditions

Conditions fall off when they are no longer applicable. This can be due to the object or entity that causes the condition being no longer around, or when a significant success or failure has been gained in theme with the source of the condition.
