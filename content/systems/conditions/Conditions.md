# Conditions

Conditions are ways the story has affected a character and what they must do to overcome them. They are not purchased, but rather, are applied by events in the game and remain until resolved. A character can have multiple instances of a Condition if they pertain to different circumstances. Conditions can be gained through exceptional success, breaking points, supernatural powers, or the Storyteller.

## Condition Sources

Each condition has a source indicating its origin and how it can be resolved. Some sources have a type which represents a specific type of origin. Such as a condition with a source of Damage (head) meaning damage done to the head.

### **Sources:**

**Damage (type)**: Lethal damage\
**Failure (type)**: Failed roll\
**Success (type)**: Successful roll\
**Breaking Point**: Experiencing a breaking point\
**Supernatural**: Exposure to the supernatural\
**Addiction**: Result of addiction\
**Natural**: Occur naturally over time 

## **Resolving Conditions**
Resolution is usually achieved through the listed methods, but other actions may also work if they end the Condition's effects. Players and the Storyteller determine resolution.

Conditions fade when they are no longer relevant, either because the source is no longer present or when the condition for resolving it has been med. There are different way to resolve a condition such as healing the injury or overcoming the issue through success or failure.

## **Earning Beats**
Resolving a Condition earns a Beat, except for those with a natural time limit. Some Conditions, marked as Persistent, last longer and can only be resolved with a significant effort. A player can earn a Beat per chapter when a Persistent Condition affects their character.
