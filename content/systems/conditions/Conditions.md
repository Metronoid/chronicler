# Conditions

Conditions represent ways in which the story has
affected a character, and what he can do to move past
those events. Players don’t buy Conditions. Instead,
events in the game apply them and they remain until
certain resolution criteria are met. A character can only
have one instance of a particular Condition unless
each applies to a distinctly different circumstance — for
example, he may be Informed about both the occult
symbol he stayed up all night to research and the inner
workings of the corporation he infiltrated. He’d resolve
each independently.

Characters can gain Conditions as a result of
many events or circumstances. A player can choose
to bring a relevant Condition into play whenever he
rolls an exceptional success. Breaking points can also cause Conditions as the character deals
with the ravages of a harsh and terrifying world.
Spirit Numina, vampiric Disciplines, and other
supernatural powers can inflict Conditions on their
unfortunate victims. Finally, the Storyteller can bring
a Condition into play whenever it would heighten
the drama of the story, or when it would make sense
as the result of a character’s actions.

The listed resolutions for each Condition
are the most common ways to end its effects; other
actions may also resolve it if they would reasonably
cause the Condition’s effects to end. Players should
work with the Storyteller to determine Condition
resolution. When a character resolves a Condition,
the player takes a Beat. However, if a Condition has
a natural time limit and then fades away, he doesn’t
take a Beat — just waiting the Condition out isn’t
enough to resolve it.

Some Conditions are marked as Persistent. These
Conditions typically last for a long time, and can only be
resolved permanently with a specific and impressive effort.
Once per chapter, a player can gain a Beat when a Persistent
Condition impacts his character’s life.

## Lingering Conditions

Conditions are designed as reminders that events that
happened earlier in the story have repercussions later.
Usually, Chekhov’s gun applies — if you put the Condition
on stage, it should cause some drama by the end. However,
Storytelling games are slippery things, and sometimes it’s
better to drop a story thread represented by a Condition for
the sake of the ongoing narrative.

For example, an emotional state like Swooned might no
longer be relevant to events in the game because a long time
has passed, or it might have been the result of a conflict with a
character the players don’t care about anymore. In those cases,
it’s perfectly fine to just cross off the Condition. The Storyteller
may choose to award a Beat as if the character resolved it.

## Improvised Conditions

As a rough guideline, a Condition typically consists of a modifier between +2 and -2 dice to a
certain type of action, or to any action taken with a certain
motivation. Conditions can also consist solely of roleplayed
effects until resolution, such as the Shaken Condition, in which the mechanical effect is the resolution.

A Condition is resolved when the character does
something significant to act on it, or when she addresses
the original source. The sample Conditions in this book
give examples of how to resolve them, but players can also
resolve them after other events with Storyteller approval if it
makes sense in the story. Resolution criteria for improvised
Conditions offer a way for the Storyteller to encourage certain
kinds of dramatic action, especially when she wants a story
point to have lingering effects on the characters. For instance,

a Condition that resolves when the character deals lethal
damage to someone clearly reflects the violent nature of that
story point. Resolution criteria also serve as an opportunity
for daisy chains of Beat-generating events, such as allowing
exceptional success on three successes instead of five, or resolving a Condition on a failed roll to encourage the player
to choose dramatic failure (and thus earn two Beats at once).

It’s best to keep the resolution criteria for a new Condition
somewhat general, rather than requiring one specific action.
For example, a Condition that resolves when the player
commits any act of vengeance allows the player flexibility in
exactly what actions the character takes, while a Condition
that resolves when the character kills a particular person
restricts the player’s options. More options are usually better.

Breaking points and exceptional successes are the most
common opportunities for creating new Conditions. When
none of the given example Conditions seem to apply, or the
player has an idea for a different way the momentous event
has affected her character, feel free to invent a Condition.
The Storyteller can also invent Conditions whenever she
wants to offer Beats for roleplaying significant behavioral
or situational shifts, or for some mechanical effect that she
wants to impose, such as a lingering penalty

If play would bog down in the search for the right
Condition, the Storyteller should just improvise one and
keep the session going.
