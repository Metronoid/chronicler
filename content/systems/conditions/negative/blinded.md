# Blinded
**Sources**: Damage (Head)

**Description**: The character’s eyes are damaged or
removed. This may cause the character to be unable to see.

**Effect**: The character suffers a -3 penalty to any rolls
that rely on vision — including attack rolls — and halves his
Defense if one eye is blinded. That penalty increases to -5
and loss of all Defense if both eyes are affected.
