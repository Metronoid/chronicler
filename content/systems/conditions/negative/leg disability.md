# Leg Disability
**Sources**: Damage (Legs)

One of your character’s legs no longer functions. Just
as for an Arm Disability, this might occur due to improper
healing, nerve damage, after tissue death due to lack of blood
flow for several hours, or due to amputation.
The Condition imposes the effects of the Leg Wrack Tilt.
(One leg: half Speed, –2 penalty on Physical rolls for movement.) Unlike the Tilt, the Condition cannot be resolved
without appropriate treatment. Note that when this affects
both legs, it leads to the Disabled Condition instead.
