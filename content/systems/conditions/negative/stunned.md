# **Stunned**
**Sources**: Aggravated Damage (Head), Aggravated Failure (Mental), Breaking Point

**Description**: Your character is dazed and unable to think
straight. Maybe her vision blurs. If she’s stunned as a result
of a blow to the head, she’s probably got a concussion.

**Effect**: A character with the Stunned Condition loses her next
action, and halves her Defense until she can next act.

**Source**: A character can be stunned by any
attack that targets her head and deals at least as much damage as her Size. Some weapons have a “stun” special ability.
These double the weapon modifier only for the purposes of
working out whether the attacker inflicts the Stunned Condition.

Attacks against the target’s head count the character’s Size as one lower for the purposes
of this Condition. The Storyteller might determine that additional
effects cause this Condition, like being caught in the blast area of
an explosion.

**Resolution**: The effects of this Condition normally only
last for a single turn. The character can end the Condition during
her own action by reflexively spending a point of Willpower
to gather her wits, though she suffers a -3 modifier to any
actions she takes that turn.
