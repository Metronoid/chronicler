# **Extreme Heat**
**Sources**: Inflicted

**Description**: The character might be stumbling through
the desert with the sun beating down on him, or running
through the steam tunnels surrounding an old boiler room.
This Condition can also be personal, the result of a debilitating fever
that spikes his temperature far above the norm. Extreme heat
is normally anything above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees
Fahrenheit), whether internal or external.

**Effect**: When the temperature is far above normal, characters can’t heal bashing damage — the extreme temperature
deals damage at the same rate normal characters heal it (a
cut might heal, but it’s replaced by sunburn or sunstroke).
Supernatural beings and characters who heal faster than
normal instead halve their normal healing rate. For every
hour that a character is continuously affected by this Condition, he
accrues a -1 penalty to all rolls. When that penalty hits -5, he
instead suffers a point of lethal damage per hour.

**Resolution**: The key to ending this Condition is simple: get
out of the heat. In a desert or similar environment, finding
shade is paramount. Elsewhere, the character needs to escape
whatever is causing the abnormal temperatures.
