# **Deprived**
**Sources**: Addiction

Your character suffers from an addiction. Because your
character is without it, she’s unable to focus and contain
herself. Remove one die from her Stamina, Resolve, and Composure dice pools. This does not influence derived traits;
it simply influences dice pools that use these Attributes.

**Resolution**: Indulge in the deprived Vice, therapy.
