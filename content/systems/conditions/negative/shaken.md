# **Shaken**
**Sources**: Dramatic Failure (Physical)

Something has frightened your character extensively. Any
time your character is taking an action where that fear might
hinder her, you may opt to fail the roll (before youâ€™ve made
the roll), and shed this Condition. This Condition can be
imposed by a successful breaking point roll.

**Example Skills**: Brawl, Firearms, Intimidation, Weaponry
