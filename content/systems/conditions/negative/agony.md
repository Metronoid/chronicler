# Agony
**Sources**: Damage (Any)

Your character experiences chronic pain: a lasting reminder
of her injuries. Head trauma might cause occasional headaches,
and injury to the bodyâ€™s nervous system and structural supports
might generate agony that makes it difficult to think or move.
These attacks impose the effects of the Stunned Tilt.
