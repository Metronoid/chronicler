# **Drugged**
**Sources**: Addiction

**Description**: The character’s mind is addled by mind altering substances, such as alcohol or drugs.

**Effect**: A generic narcotic can be represented with one
set of modifiers; the character suffers a -2 modifier to Speed
(and static Defense, if used) and a -3 penalty to all rolls in
combat, including Defense and Perception. The character
also ignores wound penalties.

**Resolution**: A generic narcotic lasts for (10 – the
victim’s Stamina + Resolve) hours. Medical help, such as
pumping the victim’s stomach or flushing his system, halves
this time.
