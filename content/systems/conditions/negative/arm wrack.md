# **Arm Wrack**
**Sources**: Damage (Arm), Failure (Physical)

**Description**: One or both of your character’s arms no longer function.
This may occur due to nerve damage, after tissue death due
to lack of blood flow for several hours, or due to amputation.
(Note that in the case of tissue death, amputation must follow,
or else sepsis will kill the character.) Improperly set fractures
or repeated minor trauma might impose it as well, though
in the latter case this might take the form of a chronic issue.

**Effect**: If your arm’s broken or otherwise busted, you drop
whatever you’re holding in that arm and can’t use it to attack
opponents — unless you’ve got the Ambidextrous Merit, you
suffer off-hand penalties for any rolls that require manual
dexterity. If this effect spreads to both limbs, you’re down to
a chance die on any rolls that require manual dexterity, and
-3 to all other Physical actions.

**Resolution**: Healing (Arm)
