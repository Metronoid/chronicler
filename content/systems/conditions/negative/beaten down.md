# **Beaten Down**
**Sources**: Aggravated Damage (Bashing), Dramatic Failure (Physical)

**Description**: The character has had the fight knocked
out of him.

**Effect**: The character cannot take active part in the
fight without extra effort. The player must spend a point of
Willpower each time he wants the character to take a violent action in the fight. He can still run, Dodge, and apply
Defense. If he wishes to take another action, the Storyteller
should judge whether the action is aggressive enough to
require the expenditure.

**Resolution**: The character surrenders and gives the
aggressor what he wants. At this point, the character regains a
point of Willpower and takes a Beat, but can take no further
action in the fight. If the aggressor’s intent is to kill or injure
the character, obviously surrendering isn’t a good option.
