# Broken
**Sources**: Breaking Point

Whatever you did or saw, something inside you snapped.
You can barely muster up the will to do your job anymore,
and anything more emotionally intense than a raised voice
makes you flinch and back down. Apply a -2 to all Social
rolls and rolls involving Resolve, and a -5 to any use of the
Intimidation Skill.

**Beat**: You back down from a confrontation or fail a roll
due to this Condition. If you regain a dot of Integrity, lose
another dot of Integrity, or achieve an exceptional success on
a breaking point, you can shed this Condition.
