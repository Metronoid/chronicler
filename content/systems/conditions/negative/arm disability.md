# ARM DISABILITY
**Sources**: Damage (Arm), Failure (Physical)

One or both of your character’s arms no longer function.
This may occur due to nerve damage, after tissue death due
to lack of blood flow for several hours, or due to amputation.
(Note that in the case of tissue death, amputation must follow,
or else sepsis will kill the character.) Improperly set fractures
or repeated minor trauma might impose it as well, though
in the latter case this might take the form of a chronic issue.
The Condition imposes the effects of the Arm Wrack Tilt.
(One arm: Drop anything held, suffer off-hand penalties for
most rolls. Both arms: Chance die on rolls requiring manual
dexterity, –3 to other Physical actions.) Unlike the Tilt, the
Condition cannot be resolved without appropriate treatment.
Origin: This Condition can easily arise out of the Arm
Wrack Tilt, but might be a lasting effect of aggravated damage
as well. Anything that severs an arm definitely imposes it.
