# **Madness**
**Sources**: Breaking Point

Your character saw or did something that jarred her
loose from reality. This isn’t a mental illness born of brain
chemistry — that, at least, might be treatable. This madness
is the product of supernatural tampering or witnessing something that humanity was never meant to comprehend. The
Storyteller has a pool of dice equal to (10 - the character’s
Integrity). Once per chapter, the Storyteller can apply those
dice as a negative modifier to any Mental or Social roll made
for the character.

**Special**: This Condition may be taken as Persistent.

**Beat**: The character fails a roll because of this Condition.
If you regain a dot of Integrity, lose another dot of Integrity,
or achieve an exceptional success on a breaking point, you
can shed this Condition.
