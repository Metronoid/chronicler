# **Crippled**
**Sources**: Aggravated Damage (Legs)

Your character has limited or no ability to walk. Her
Speed trait is effectively 1. She must rely on a wheelchair or
other device to travel. A manual wheelchair’s Speed is equal
to your character’s Strength, and requires use of her hands.
Electric wheelchairs have a Speed of 3, but allow the character
free use of her hands.

An injury can cause this Condition temporarily, in which
case it is resolved when the injury heals and the character
regains mobility.
