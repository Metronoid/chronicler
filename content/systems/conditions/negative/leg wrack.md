# **Leg Wrack**
**Sources**: Aggravated Damage (Legs)

**Description**: Your leg feels like it’s going to snap clean off
whenever you move; when you stop moving you feel a burning
numbness that encourages you to avoid action.

**Effect**: If your leg is broken, sprained, or dislocated,
halve your Speed and suffer a -2 penalty on Physical rolls
that require movement (and Defense). If both of your legs are wracked, you fall over — taking the Knocked Down Condition — and
cannot get up. Your Speed is reduced to 1; if you want to
move at all, you cannot take any other action. Physical rolls
that require movement are reduced to a chance die.

**Resolution**: If the Condition is inflicted as a result of an
attack, mark an X under the leftmost Health box affected by
that attack. The Condition ends when that damage that caused it
has healed. If the damage that inflicts this Condition is aggravated,
the character loses use of his leg permanently.
