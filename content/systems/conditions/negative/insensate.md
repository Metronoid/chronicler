# **Insensate**
**Sources**: Breaking Point

**Description**: The character shuts down, either due to
extreme fear or sudden pleasure. He may huddle in a corner,
cringe away from sudden noises, or stare into space as waves
of pleasure lap over him.

**Effect**: The character can’t take any actions until the Condition
is resolved. He can apply Defense to incoming attacks, and
if he takes any damage from an attack, he’s knocked free of
whatever fogged his brain.

**Source**: Several supernatural powers can leave
their victim in a trance-like state of heightened emotion,
whether a vampire’s mind-affecting tricks, or the pants shitting terror of witnessing a werewolf take on an inhuman
form. A truly heroic amount of alcohol or a hallucinogenic
drug might have similar effects; administering such a drug is
a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, which suffers a -1 modifier
for the improvised weapon.

**Resolution**: The Condition wears off at the end of the scene.
The victim can spend a point of Willpower before then to
act normally for one turn. A successful attack will also end
the Condition. If a character has been knocked insensible by drugs,
then when this Condition ends it is replaced with the Drugged Condition.
