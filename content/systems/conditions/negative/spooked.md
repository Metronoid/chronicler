Your character has seen something supernatural not
overt enough to terrify her, but unmistakably otherworldly.
How your character responds to this is up to you, but it captivates her and eats her attention. You can shed this Condition
when your characterâ€™s fear and fascination causes her to do
something that hinders the group or complicates things (she
goes off alone to investigate a strange noise, stays up all night
researching, runs away instead of holding her ground, etc.).
