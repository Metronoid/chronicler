# Obsession
**Sources**: Failure (Mental), Failure (Aspiration)

Something’s on your character’s mind, and she just can’t
shake it. If she’s abiding by that obsession, exploring that
emotion, or otherwise pursuing the object of the obsession,
enjoy the 10-again quality on all rolls. When she’s not, you
lose the 10-again quality.
