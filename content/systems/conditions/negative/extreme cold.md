# **Extreme Cold**

**Sources**: Inflicted

**Description**: Bone-chilling winds bite through the character, or trudging through knee-deep snow takes all of the
sensation from his limbs. Any time the temperature gets
down below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit),
a character can suffer from the cold’s effects. This Condition can
sometimes be personal, as a result of a medical condition like
hypothermia or a supernatural power.

**Effect**: When the temperature is below freezing, characters
can’t heal bashing damage — the extreme temperature deals damage at the same rate normal characters heal it (a cut might turn
to frostbite, for instance). Supernatural beings and characters
who heal faster than normal instead halve their normal healing
rate. For every hour that a character is continuously affected by
this Condition, he accrues a -1 penalty to all rolls. When that penalty
hits -5, he instead suffers a point of lethal damage per hour.

**Resolution**: The best way to escape the freezing cold
is to find a source of warmth, either a building with working
heat, or warm clothing. A character who has hypothermia
requires medical attention.
