# Deaf
**Sources**: Damage (Head)

**Description**: The character can’t hear. Maybe he’s suffering intense tinnitus, can only hear the roaring of blood in
his ears, or has been deafened by a gunshot.

**Effect**: If the character is deaf in one ear, he suffers a -3
penalty to hearing-based Perception rolls. A character who
is struck deaf in both ears only gets a chance die on hearing based Perception rolls, and suffers a -2 penalty to all combat related dice rolls — suddenly losing the ability to hear the
people around you is tremendously disorienting.

**Resolution**: Healing (Head)
