# Deaf
**Sources**: Damage (Head)

Injury to the brain or structures of one or both ears causes
deafness. In the latter case this might come from sudden or
repeated exposure to loud noise, such as from a powerful
PA system or firearms. Deafness imposes the same effects as
the Deafened Tilt (One ear: –3 Perception rolls. Both ears:
Chance die on Perception rolls, –2 to combat rolls.)
