# Guilty

Your character is experiencing deep-seated feelings of guilt
and remorse. This Condition is commonly applied after a
successful breaking point roll. While the character is under
the effects of this Condition, he receives a -2 to any Resolve
or Composure rolls to defend against Subterfuge, Empathy,
or Intimidation rolls.

**Resolution**: The character makes restitution for whatever
he did; the character confesses his crimes.
