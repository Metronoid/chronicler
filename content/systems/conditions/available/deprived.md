# Deprived

Your character suffers from an addiction. Because your
character is without it, sheâ€™s unable to focus and contain
herself. Remove one die from her Stamina, Resolve, and Composure dice pools. This does not influence derived traits;
it simply influences dice pools that use these Attributes.

A character suffering from addiction may take this
Condition as a Persistent Condition.

**Resolution**: Indulge in the deprived Vice, therapy.
