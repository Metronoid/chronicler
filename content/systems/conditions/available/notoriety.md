# Notoriety

Whether or not your character actually did something heinous in the past, the wrong people think he did. This causes disgust or ostracism by the common public. Your character suffers
a -2 on any Social rolls against those that know of his notoriety.
If using Social Maneuvering (p.81), the character must open one
extra Door if his target knows of his notoriety. Oftentimes, this
Condition comes from rumors and smear campaigns.

**Skills**: Subterfuge, Socialize

**Resolution**: The story is debunked or the characterâ€™s
name is cleared.
