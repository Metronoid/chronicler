# Soulless

A creature or phenomenon has stripped the character of
her soul. Without a soul, she canâ€™t attempt abjuration, warding, or binding. She is also more susceptible to possession any dice pools to resist being taken over or possessed by
another entity are at a -2 dice penalty. The effects on Integrity
and Willpower, though, are more severe. For as long as she
has this Condition, she does not regain 

Willpower through surrender or rest, and her use of
Virtue and Vice is reversed. She may regain one Willpower
point per scene by fulfilling her Virtue, and regains full
Willpower once per chapter by fulfilling her Vice. Regaining
Willpower through Vice, though, is now a breaking point
with a -5 penalty unless the character has reached Integrity 1.

**Beat**: Gain a beat whenever the character loses Integrity
because she indulged her Vice.

**Resolution**: This Condition is only resolved if the character regains her soul.
