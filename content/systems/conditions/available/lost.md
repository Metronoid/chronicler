# Lost

Your character has no idea where she is, or how to reach
her target. She cannot make any headway toward her goal
without first navigating and finding out where she is. This
requires a successful Wits + Streetwise action (in the city) or
Wits + Survival action (in the wilderness).

**Resolution**: Abandoning the goal, successfully navigating.
