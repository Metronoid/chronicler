# Blind

Your character cannot see. Any rolls requiring sight may
only use a chance die. If another sense can be reasonably substituted, make the roll at -3 instead. In a combat situation, she
suffers the drawbacks of the Blinded Tilt instead.

**Special**: This Condition may be taken as Persistent.

**Resolution**: Limitation or difficulty that heightens immediate danger.
