# Arm Wrack

**Description**: Your arm burns with pain and then goes
numb. It could be dislocated, sprained, or broken, but
whatever’s wrong with it means you can’t move your limb.

**Effect**: If your arm’s broken or otherwise busted, you drop
whatever you’re holding in that arm and can’t use it to attack
opponents — unless you’ve got the Ambidextrous Merit, you
suffer off-hand penalties for any rolls that require manual
dexterity. If this effect spreads to both limbs, you’re down to
a chance die on any rolls that require manual dexterity, and
-3 to all other Physical actions.

**Causing the Tilt**: Some supernatural powers can cripple
a victim’s limbs or break bones with a touch. A character can
have his arm knocked out by a targeted blow to the arm (-2 penalty) that deals more damage than the character’s Stamina. A
targeted blow to the hand inflicts this Tilt if it does any damage.

**Ending the Tilt**: If the Tilt is inflicted as a result of an attack,
mark an X under the leftmost Health box affected by that attack.
The Tilt ends when the damage that caused it has healed. If the
damage that inflicts this Tilt is aggravated, the character loses
the use of his arm (or completely loses his arm) permanently.
