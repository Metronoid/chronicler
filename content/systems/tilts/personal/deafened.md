# Deafened

**Description**: The character can’t hear. Maybe he’s suffering intense tinnitus, can only hear the roaring of blood in
his ears, or has been deafened by a gunshot.

**Effect**: If the character is deaf in one ear, he suffers a -3
penalty to hearing-based Perception rolls. A character who
is struck deaf in both ears only gets a chance die on hearingbased Perception rolls, and suffers a -2 penalty to all combatrelated dice rolls — suddenly losing the ability to hear the
people around you is tremendously disorienting.

**Causing the Tilt**: A particularly loud noise within 10
feet of the character may cause temporary hearing loss, as
though the character were deaf in both ears. Alternatively,
a targeted attack on the ear at a -4 penalty can deafen a
character. Supernatural creatures with heightened senses can
be deafened by loud noises at greater distances.

**Ending the Tilt**: Deafness caused by loud noises fades
after (10 - the victim’s Stamina + Resolve) turns. If an attack
against the character’s ear does any points of damage, mark
an X under the leftmost Health box affected by that attack. If
the damage inflicted is Aggravated the character loses hearing
in the ear permanently. Otherwise, the condition ends when
the damage that caused the Tilt is healed.
