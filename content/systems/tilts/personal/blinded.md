# Blinded

**Description**: The character’s eyes are damaged or
removed.

**Effect**: The character suffers a -3 penalty to any rolls
that rely on vision — including attack rolls — and halves his
Defense if one eye is blinded. That penalty increases to -5
and loss of all Defense if both eyes are affected.

**Causing the Tilt**: The normal way to inflict the Tilt is
to deal damage to the target’s eyes, a specified attack with a
-5 penalty (see Specified Targets, p. 92). A successful attack
normally damages one eye. It takes an exceptional success to
totally blind an attacker. An attacker can inflict temporary
blindness by slashing at her opponent’s brow, throwing sand
into his eyes, or kicking up dirt. This requires an attack roll
of Dexterity + Athletics with a -3 penalty, and the victim’s
Defense applies to this attack. If it succeeds, the target is
Blinded for the next turn.

**Ending the Tilt**: If an attack against the character’s eye
does any points of damage, mark an X under the leftmost
Health box affected by that attack. If the damage inflicted is
aggravated the character loses vision in that eye permanently.
Otherwise, the condition ends when the damage that caused
the Tilt is healed.
