# Insane

**Description**: The character suffers from a panic attack,
sudden imbalance, or a full-on psychotic break. Her pulse
races, her mind cannot focus on what she wants. The world’s
an unstable place, and she’s unable to keep her balance.

**Effect**: Someone suffering a psychotic break isn’t the sort
of person to go down without a fight. Her stated intent might
be irrational or just plain impossible, and she might have fewer
ethical problems with using extreme violence to get what she
wants. The character gains a +1 bonus to all combat rolls, but
takes actions after everyone else (if two characters suffer from the
Insane Tilt, both act after everyone else but compare Initiative
as normal). A character suffering from this Tilt cannot spend
Willpower in combat, and suffers a -3 penalty to all Social rolls.

**Causing the Tilt**: Faced with extraordinary circumstances,
any character with an appropriate Condition may acquire
the Insane Tilt. The Storyteller can call for a Resolve +
Composure roll to resist a general anxiety that gnaws at the
character’s mind; if the character fails, he gains the Tilt. If
the character witnesses something truly horrific — a daughter
watches her father walk to the end of the garden and shoot
himself in the head, smiling all the while; a man stumbles
into the wrong office at work and sees his coworkers feasting
on the intern’s organs; a solder sees her unit gunned down
by a sniper while she can do nothing — the Storyteller can
rule that the Tilt is unavoidable.

A character can work to inspire another character’s madness in order to cause this Tilt. She could orchestrate events
that she hopes will provoke a psychotic break, but that’s
amateur hour. A professional swaps out her victim’s meds,
giving stimulants just as his bipolar cycle ticks into mania, or
dosing a paranoid schizophrenic with hallucinogenic drugs.
Some supernatural creatures possess mind-affecting powers that can apply this Tilt, even to characters who do not
have an appropriate Condition.

**Ending the Tilt**: The specific effects of this Tilt don’t
normally last beyond the end of the scene. A character can
try to force her mind to a state of balance, but it’s not easy.
She must sit and focus on blocking out the craziness. She rolls
Resolve + Composure as an instant action, contested by a dice
pool of (10 - her Willpower). She can’t take any other actions
that turn, and doesn’t apply Defense against any attacks.
