# Blizzard

**Description**: Heavy snowfall carpets the ground and is
whipped up by howling winds into a barrage of whirling white.

**Effect**: Blizzards make it very hard to see for any real distance. Rolls to see things close to the character’s person, out
to an arm’s length away, suffer a -1 penalty. Each additional
10 yards inflicts an additional -1 penalty (cumulative) on all
visual Perception rolls. This penalty also applies to ranged
attack rolls. Moving through snow is difficult. Every four
inches of snow applies a -1 penalty to appropriate Physical
rolls, including combat rolls, Athletics, and the like. The
Blizzard Tilt rarely applies by itself — the Storyteller may also
inflict any or all of the Extreme Cold, Heavy Winds, or Ice
Tilts (all found below).

**Causing the Tilt**: For the most part, the weather is out
of the characters’ control; the Storyteller should telegraph
an incoming blizzard before it hits, but it’s ultimately up to
her. Some supernatural powers might grant a character the
power to create a blizzard.

**Ending the Tilt**: Without supernatural powers, characters can’t
end a blizzard. The best they can manage is to escape the weather
or wait for it to stop. Proper equipment (such as goggles and snow
boots) can add +1 to +3 to a roll, offsetting some of the penalties.
If someone is causing this Tilt through a supernatural power, it’s
possible that the characters could disrupt his concentration.
