# Tilts

Tilts are a unified way of applying circumstances to both
characters and scenes during violent encounters. Tilts are mechanically similar to Conditions, but they affect characters and
scenes in combat only. Outside combat, use Conditions instead.

Tilts do not give players Beats when they end, but the
effects of a Tilt can easily cause a Condition. For instance, a
character in a fight gets a handful of road salt flung into his
eyes and receives the Blinded Tilt. When combat ends, this shifts to the Blind Condition. Resolving this Condition gives
the character a Beat. If the character enters combat again before the Condition is resolved, the Blinded Tilt applies again.

Tilts come in two forms: Personal and Environmental.
Personal Tilts only apply to one character and include ways in
which that character can overcome the effect. Environmental

Tilts affect the whole scene, and offer ways for individual
characters to mitigate their effects.
