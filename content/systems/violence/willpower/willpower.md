# Willpower

Violence is brutal; there’s no way around it. Sure, armor
or supernatural powers can protect a combatant from the
worst of it, but one lucky hit can reduce anyone to a bag of
bones. In the Chronicles of Darkness, combat isn’t glorious
or romantic. It’s a carnal thrill, bloody and rough, and the
better you get at it, the more things out there will want your
head.

Players should expect that in order to win fights, they
usually need to spend Willpower. It takes a perfect
storm of skill, grit, adrenaline, and blind luck to walk out of a
skirmish in one piece, especially when deadly weapons are involved. Willpower in combat represents the grit and adrenaline.
Characters only fight when something’s important enough
to hurt someone over, so players should be willing to ante up
their character’s precious mental resources to come out on top.

While a player has to monitor her character’s Willpower
throughout the whole story, a Storyteller character won’t
be present in most of the scenes, so it doesn’t matter if he
blows more Willpower — he can regain it offscreen, and even
if he doesn’t, it’s not like he’s going to spend it later. This
is especially noticeable in direct conflict, when Storyteller
characters can spend Willpower to hurt characters who have
surrendered, enhance their attacks, and defend themselves
with greater ability than the players’ characters

The Storyteller should reduce his characters’ available
Willpower in each scene to reflect their “one shot” nature. Mooks, thugs, and similar nameless characters don’t have any
Willpower available to spend. Minor named characters — the
kind who recur but aren’t the main antagonists of a story —
have one point of Willpower available. Recurring antagonists
and major Storyteller characters can spend up to half their
maximum Willpower in a scene. 

Storyteller characters with reduced Willpower totals can
still regain spent points through normal means, but can’t
go above their modified Willpower total for a scene. Note,
though, that their Resolve + Composure values are unaffected,
in case the Storyteller needs to have them roll this dice pool,
and supernatural powers that drain Willpower work normally.
