# Unarmed Combat

These rules present special cases that come up when
fighting without weapons.

## Bite

A human’s teeth have a -1 weapon modifier and deal
bashing damage. Animals and some other creatures treat
their teeth like weapons, dealing lethal damage to mortals.
Animal bites have a weapon modifier depending on the kind
of animal: a wolf applies +1, while a great white shark gets +4.

Humans can only bite as part of a grapple, using the
Damage move (see below).

## Disarm

To snatch an opponent’s weapon away, roll Strength +
Brawl contested by the opponent’s Strength + Athletics. If
the attacker succeeds, the opponent drops his weapon. If
the attacker gets an exceptional success, she takes possession
of the opponent’s weapon. On a dramatic failure, she takes
damage equal to the weapon’s modifier — if she’s struggling
over a gun, for instance, the gun goes off.

## Grapple

To grab an opponent, roll Strength + Brawl - Defense. On
a success, both characters are grappling. If the attacker rolls
an exceptional success, he picks a move from the list below
to enact immediately.

During each subsequent turn, both grappling characters
make a contested Strength + Brawl versus Strength + Brawl
action on the higher of the two characters’ Initiatives. The
winner picks a move from the list below to enact immediately,
or two moves on an exceptional success.

• **Break Free** from the grapple. The character throws
off his opponent; they’re both no longer grappling.
Succeeding at this move is a reflexive action, so the character can take another action immediately afterwards.

• **Control Weapon**, either by drawing a weapon the
character has holstered or turning his opponent’s
weapon against her. He keeps control until his opponent performs a Control Weapon move.

• **Damage** the opponent by dealing bashing damage equal to the character’s rolled successes. If the character performing the move previously succeeded
at a Control Weapon action, add the weapon modifier
to his successes.

• **Disarm the opponent**, removing a weapon from the
grapple entirely. The character must first have succeeded at a Control Weapon move.

• **Drop Prone**, throwing both characters to the ground
(see “Going Prone,” below). A character must Break
Free before rising.

• **Hold** the opponent in place. Neither character can
apply Defense against incoming attacks.

• **Restrain** the opponent with duct tape, zip ties,
or a painful joint lock. The opponent suffers the
Immobilized Condition. A character can only use
this move if he’s already succeeded in a Hold move. If
he uses equipment to Restrain the opponent, he can
leave the grapple.

• **Take Cover** using the opponent’s body. Any ranged
attacks made until the end of the turn automatically
hit the opponent (see “Human Shields,” below).

## Touching an Opponent

Sometimes, a combatant doesn’t want to do damage.
Maybe she wants to plant a bug, or use some supernatural
power. Roll Dexterity + Brawl or Dexterity + Weaponry to
tap an opponent with a weapon. A successful roll deals no
damage.
