# Down and Dirty Combat

The Storyteller might decide that a player character can
get what she wants without focusing on the details of the
fight. Maybe she’s picking on people weaker than her. Maybe
she’s internalized the mechanics of violence to a degree that
far surpasses the average Joe. Maybe the fight’s not the most
important thing going on with regard to the character’s
intent. In these cases, the Storyteller can opt to use Down
and Dirty Combat.

This system resolves the entire fight in a single roll. If
multiple player characters are involved and have separate
intents, such as one character trying to fight past a guard
while another beats information out of a flunky, each intent
is resolved as a separate Down and Dirty Combat action. If
the group only has one intent but multiple player characters are participating, they can use teamwork on the
roll. Players can call for Down and Dirty Combat, with the
Storyteller’s approval. Storyteller characters might deal damage as a result of a Down and Dirty Combat, but they can’t
initiate one.

**Dice Pool**: Combat pool (Dexterity + Firearms, Strength +
Brawl, or Strength + Weaponry) versus either the opponent’s
combat pool (as above) or an attempt to escape (Strength or
Dexterity + Athletics). Ignore Defense on this roll.

**Action**: Contested; resistance is reflexive

## Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure**: The character’s opponent gets the upper hand in addition to dealing damage, as with failure. This
usually includes the opposite of the character’s intent — if
she wanted to disable the guards so she could escape, she is
stunned instead.

**Failure**: The opponent wins the contest. If the opponent
used a combat pool, he deals damage equal to the difference
in successes plus weapon modifier. Also, the opponent escapes unless he wants to press the combat.

**Success**: The character wins the contest. She deals damage
equal to the difference in successes plus her weapon modifier
and achieves her intent. If her intent includes killing her
opponents, then she does so.

**Exceptional Success**: As a success, and the character also
gains a point of Willpower from the rush of inflicting violence
on an inferior opponent.
