# Attack

On each character’s turn, he can attack using one of the
following dice pools:

• **Unarmed Combat**: Strength + Brawl - opponent’s
Defense

• **Melee Combat**: Strength + Weaponry - opponent’s
Defense

• **Ranged Combat**: Dexterity + Firearms

• **Thrown Weapons**: Dexterity + Athletics - opponent’s
Defense

Resolve the attack roll like any other action. Determine
damage by adding the successes rolled to any weapon modifier. The target fills this many Health boxes with whichever
type of damage was dealt. See “Injury and Healing,” below.
