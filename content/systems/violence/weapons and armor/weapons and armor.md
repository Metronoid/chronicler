# Weapons and Armor

Weapons are one of the fastest ways to turn a fight into
a murder. Sometimes, that’s what you want; pulling a gun
shows you’re serious about killing people.

A weapon’s modifier, or damage rating, adds bonus successes
to a successful attack roll. When a weapon might help out in
other ways, like using a chain to grapple someone, or a gun to
intimidate her, add the weapon’s modifier to the attack roll.

Every weapon deals lethal damage. However, some supernatural creatures don’t take lethal damage from weapons.
The full traits of a range of weapons are presented in the
Ranged and Melee Weapons Charts.

## Improvised Weapons

The weapons charts can only go so far. Characters who
grab lamps and pool cues still stand a chance of doing serious damage.

If your improvised weapon is close enough to an existing weapon profile, use that. For
example, a pool cue might count as a baton. Otherwise, an
improvised weapon does (Durability - 1) damage, with an
Initiative penalty and Strength requirement equal to the
weapon’s Size.

Using an improvised weapon reduces your attack pool by
one die. On a successful attack, the weapon takes the same
amount of damage as it inflicts; Durability reduces this damage as normal. Once the weapon’s Structure is reduced to 0,
the object is wrecked.

## Armor

Armor provides protection against attacks, including
bullets and knives. Police officers and other law enforcement
agencies frequently rely on it.

• Ballistic armor applies to incoming firearms attacks.
Each point of ballistic armor downgrades one point
of damage from lethal to bashing.

• General armor applies to all attacks. Each point of
general armor reduces the total damage taken by one
point, starting with the most severe type of damage.

If armor has both ballistic and general ratings, apply the
ballistic armor first.

When applying armor to an attack dealing lethal damage, the character always takes at least one point of bashing
damage from the shock of the blow.

## Armor-Piercing

Some weapons have an armor piercing quality, usually
between one and three. When attacking someone wearing
armor, subtract the piercing quality from the target’s armor. Subtract from ballistic armor first, then general armor.
Armor-piercing attacks in close combat subtract from general
armor only.

When shooting at an object or a person in cover
subtract the piercing quality from the object’s Durability.
