# Injury and Healing

Characters can suffer three types of damage. Fists and feet,
along with other kinds of low-impact trauma, deal bashing
damage. Brass knuckles, knives, and speeding trucks deal
lethal damage. Human characters always take lethal damage
from weapons. Some horrifying supernatural powers deal aggravated damage. When something deals aggravated damage
directly, it’s quite obvious. Flesh bubbles and sloughs away.
Foaming pustules taint the victim’s flesh. Blackened veins
streak out from the site of the injury.

A character’s Health track contains a number of boxes
equal to his Health trait, determined by his Stamina + Size.

## Marking Damage

When a character suffers bashing damage, mark it with a
slash (/) in the leftmost empty box of his health track.

When a character suffers lethal damage, mark it with an
X in the leftmost box of his health track that doesn’t contain
lethal or aggravated damage. If you mark over a point of
bashing damage, it moves one box to the right.

When a character suffers aggravated damage, mark it with
a large asterisk (*) in the leftmost box that doesn’t already
contain aggravated damage. If you mark over a point of
bashing or lethal damage, it all moves one box to the right.

Always mark the most severe injuries at the left of a
character’s health track, and push any less severe injuries to
the right. Characters heal their rightmost health boxes first
and progress left.

## Wound Penalties

As a character takes damage, it impairs her ability to act.
When one of her three rightmost Health boxes has damage marked, she suffers a penalty accordingly. Subtract this penalty from every action she performs, including rolling for
Initiative, but not including Stamina rolls to stay conscious.

## Full Health Tracks and Upgrading Damage

If a character’s Health track is filled with bashing damage,
each point of further bashing or lethal damage upgrades the
leftmost point of bashing damage to lethal — turn one of the
slashes into an X. When a character’s rightmost Health box
has bashing damage marked in it, his player must make a
reflexive Stamina roll each turn for him to remain conscious.

If a character’s Health track is filled with lethal damage,
each point of further damage upgrades an existing point of
lethal damage to aggravated. Turn the leftmost X into an
asterisk. When a character’s rightmost Health box has lethal
damage marked in it, he takes another point of damage each
minute (upgrading existing lethal damage to aggravated) until
he receives medical attention, mundane or supernatural.

If a character’s Health track is filled with aggravated
damage, he’s dead.

## Temporary Health Boxes

Some supernatural powers can bestow temporary Health
boxes. If a character takes damage in a temporary Health box
and then the effect that bestowed it ends, the damage rolls over
into his permanent Health boxes as if he had just taken it anew.
Healing

Characters need time to heal once they’ve been beaten
to a pulp. Some supernatural creatures have other ways to
heal, but human characters rely on time and medical care to
set broken bones and heal bullet wounds.

A character heals her rightmost Health box at the rate
indicated below. The healing time is enough for the wound to
fully recover; lethal damage doesn’t downgrade into bashing.

Normally, a character can heal without medical attention,
though use of the Medicine Skill helps her recover. The only exception is if a character has all her Health
boxes full of lethal damage — she’s bleeding out. She can’t
recover from that without urgent medical attention and
emergency surgery.

Wounds recover at the following rates:

• **Bashing**: One point per 15 minutes

• **Lethal**: One point per two days

• **Aggravated**: One point per week

## Medical Care

The Medicine Skill can be used to speed up healing.
Medical care is an extended action, requiring successes equal to
the total number of points of damage suffered by the patient. In
the field or ER, the dice pool is Dexterity + Medicine, and the
interval is one minute. In long-term hospital care, the pool is
Intelligence + Medicine, and the interval is one hour. Usually,
any Conditions from a failure afflict the patient rather than
the caregiver, but this is at Storyteller discretion.

Achieving sufficient successes restores one Health point
lost to bashing damage, in addition to any healing that the
character already does under his own power.

Round-the-clock, intensive care diminishes a patient’s
injuries, downgrading the nature of wounds by one degree.
Thus, a lethal wound can be downgraded to bashing, and
an aggravated wound can be downgraded to lethal. Such
treatment can occur only in a hospital or other intensive-care
facility. An extended Intelligence + Medicine roll is made.
The number of successes required is five for a lethal wound
and 10 for an aggravated one. Each roll requires an hour.

This kind of treatment always focuses on the worst of
the patient’s injuries first. Thus, an aggravated wound is
downgraded to lethal before a lethal wound is downgraded
to bashing. No more than one wound can be downgraded
per day of treatment.

Note that this treatment does not eliminate wounds. It
simply minimizes them. A patient must heal downgraded
injuries completely by himself or receive other treatment to
eliminate them.
