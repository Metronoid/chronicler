# Intent

Most people don’t resort to violence unless they want
something badly, more than they care about other people’s
safety. The first thing to do when combat begins — before
worrying about who attacks first or anything like that —
is to determine what each character wants to get out of
the fight. Boil it down into a simple sentence that starts
with the words “I want”: “I want to kill Johnny,” “I want
the book that Francesca is holding,” or “I want what’s in
Larry’s wallet.” Even “I want to get away from this guntoting psycho” is a valid intent. A character’s intent has to
be something he could achieve through an act of violence
in the current scene — even a gunman on the White House
lawn couldn’t get away with “I want to be President of the
United States.”

By stating her character’s intent, a player is setting out how
much her character is willing to hurt, or even kill, someone
else in order to get it. If a character’s intent has nothing to
do with hurting people and she ends up killing someone, she
loses a point of Willpower, in addition to probably suffering
a breaking point.

## Optional Rule: Beaten Down & Surrender

Often, violent solutions to problems are grisly, ugly, and
over fast. Using this optional rule, any character that takes
more than his Stamina in bashing damage or any amount of
lethal damage gains the Beaten Down Tilt: he’s
had the fight knocked out of him. He must spend a point
of Willpower every time he wants to take a violent action
until the end of the fight. He can still apply Defense against
incoming attacks, Dodge, and flee, but it takes a point of
Willpower to swing or shoot back.

However, he can instead surrender, giving his attacker
what she wants according to her declared intent. If a character
gives in, he gains a point of Willpower and his player takes a
Beat, but he takes no more part in the fight. If his opponent
wants to attack him, she’s got to spend a point of Willpower
to do so, and probably suffers a breaking point. If everyone
on one side has surrendered, the fight’s over and the other
side gets what they want.

If one side’s intent involves violence for its own sake,
the other side can’t surrender — not without being killed or
harmed anyway. If that’s the case, the aggressor’s intended
victims don’t get the Beaten Down Tilt, and gain no benefits
from surrendering. When someone wants to kill you, the
only thing you can do is to try to stop her, whether you run
like hell or unload a shotgun at her.

These rules only apply to people who would incur a breaking point for committing (or attempting) “murder.” Creatures
that don’t have a problem killing people in general can ignore
surrender without penalty and don’t have the fight beaten
out of them like normal folks.
