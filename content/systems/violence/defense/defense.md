# Defense

Subtract the character’s Defense from any unarmed,
melee, or thrown attacks of which the character is aware.
Every time a character applies his Defense against an attack,
reduce his Defense by 1 against subsequent attacks until the
start of the next turn, when the character at the top of the
Initiative order acts again. Spending a point of Willpower
increases his Defense by 2, but only against one attacker.

A player can choose not to apply his character’s Defense
against some attacks. If two unarmed gangbangers attack
before a chainsaw-wielding lunatic, he might want to let the
gangbangers get their blows in, and apply his full Defense
against the maniac swinging a chainsaw at his head.

Some types of combat actions require a character to
sacrifice his Defense for the turn. A character may only sacrifice Defense for one such action at a time; for instance, he
couldn’t give up Defense to perform an All-Out Attack and
Charge at the same time. He must choose one.

Defense does not apply against Firearms attacks.

## Dodge

At any point before a character’s action, she can choose to
Dodge. Doing so takes up her normal action. When Dodging,
double the character’s Defense but do not subtract it from attack rolls. Instead, roll Defense as a dice pool, and subtract
each success from the attacker’s successes. If this reduces the
attacker’s successes to zero, the attack deals no damage. Apply
successes from Dodging before adding any weapon modifier.
Dodging only works when Defense can apply.

Against multiple opponents, reduce Defense by 1 for each
opponent before doubling it to determine the Dodge dice
pool. If Defense is reduced to 0, roll a chance die. A dramatic
failure when Dodging leaves the character off balance; reduce
her Defense by 1 for the next turn.
