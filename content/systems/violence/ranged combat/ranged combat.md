# Ranged Combat

These rules present special cases that come up when
shooting at people.

## Aiming

If a character takes an instant action to aim carefully at an
opponent with a ranged weapon, the player enjoys a one-die
bonus to the attack roll when he fires on the next turn. A
character can aim for multiple turns in a row at the same target,
to a maximum of a three-die bonus. If a character applies his
Defense while aiming, he loses his accumulated bonus and
must start over. Aiming is incompatible with autofire (below).

## Autofire

Automatic weapons can fire a short, medium, or long
burst in place of a single shot.

• **Short Burst**: Three bullets fired at the same target.
The shooter enjoys a +1 to her dice pool.

• **Medium Burst**: 10 bullets, which can hit one to three
targets standing close together. The shooter receives a
two-die bonus to her dice pool. If firing at more than one target, subtract the total number of targets from
the shooter’s pool, then make one attack roll per target.

• **Long Burst**: 20 bullets at as many targets as the shooter
wants. The shooter receives a three-die bonus to her
dice pool. If firing at more than one target, subtract
the total number of targets from the shooter’s pool,
then make one attack roll per target.

## Covering Fire

Characters can use automatic weapons to provide covering
fire — firing on full auto to dissuade enemies from coming out
into the open. Covering fire is only possible with a weapon
capable of fully automatic fire.

The player states the general area at which he is firing, and
rolls Dexterity + Firearms. If the roll succeeds, each character
in the affected area must make a choice on his next action.
He can avoid the attack, either running to cover within range
of his Speed, or dropping prone (see “Going Prone,” below).
Or, he can take an action as normal but suffer damage based
on the Covering Fire successes + weapon modifier. Covering
fire takes 10 bullets, the same as firing a medium burst.

## Firearms in Close Combat

Any firearm larger than Size 1 is too big to accurately shoot
someone when fists and crowbars are the order of the day. In
close combat, the target’s Defense against Firearms attacks
is increased by the gun’s (Size +1). If using a gun larger than
a pistol to bludgeon the opponent, treat it as an improvised
crowbar.

## Range

The firearms chart (below) lists the short, medium, and
long ranges of some sample firearms. Shooting a target at
medium range imposes a -1 penalty, while shooting a target at
long range increases that to -2 penalty. Shooting at targets beyond long range reduces the attack dice pool to a chance die.

Thrown weapons have a short range of (Strength +
Dexterity + Athletics - object’s Size) yards or meters, doubled
for medium range, and doubled again for long range.
Aerodynamic objects double each range — so an aerodynamic
object’s long range is (Strength + Dexterity + Athletics) * 8
yards or meters. Characters can only throw objects with a
Size less than their Strength.

## Cover and Concealment

Hiding behind something is a good way to not get shot.
How effective it is depends on how much the cover hides.
Concealment penalties apply to a shooter’s dice pool.

• **Barely Concealed**: -1 (hiding behind an office chair)

• **Partially Concealed**: -2 (hiding behind the hood of a
car, with upper body exposed)

• **Substantially Concealed**: -3 (crouching behind a car)

A character who is concealed and wants to fire at someone else takes a penalty to his Firearms attack that’s one
less than the penalty afforded by the character’s protection so if he’s substantially concealed, he can fire back with
a –2 die penalty.

If a target’s entirely hidden by something substantial, he’s
in cover. If the cover’s Durability is greater than the weapon
modifier, the bullets can’t penetrate the cover. Otherwise,
subtract the cover’s Durability from the attacker’s damage
roll. If the cover is transparent (bulletproof glass, for example),
subtract half the cover’s Durability, rounding down. Both the
object and the target take any remaining damage.

## Shooting into Close Combat

If a character fires or throws a ranged weapon at a target
who is involved in close combat with other characters she
doesn’t want to hit, like allies or bystanders, the player takes
a -2 to her attack for each combatant she wants to avoid, or
-4 for a combatant who is currently in a grapple. This rule
doesn’t apply to autofire (see above).

## Human Shields

Sometimes, the only available cover is another person — be he
a terrified member of the public or a lifelong friend. Characters
who use human shields treat them as cover, with Durability equal
to the victim’s Stamina + any armor. Unlike normal cover, the
victim takes all of the damage from the attack.

Using a human shield is almost certainly a breaking point. For a human, this means a pretty severe modifier
(-3 or more) if the victim dies.

## Reloading

Reloading a firearm is an instant action. If a character
needs to load bullets separately, she cannot apply her Defense
on the same turn. If she has a magazine or speed loader, she
doesn’t lose her Defense
