# General Combat Factors

Some actions apply to all kinds of fights.

## Movement

A character can move his Speed in a single turn and still
take an instant action. He can give up his action to move at
double his normal Speed.

## Charging

A character can sacrifice her Defense for the turn to move
up to twice her Speed and make a Brawl or Weaponry attack
in the same action, charging in heedless of incoming threats.
If she has already applied her Defense against an attack before
her action occurs, she can’t Charge.

## Going Prone

When a character can’t find cover, the next best thing
when bullets are flying is to drop flat to the ground. Ranged
and thrown attacks against him suffer a -2. A standing attacker using Brawl or Weaponry to attack instead gains a +2.

A character can drop prone at any point before his action.
Dropping to the ground costs his action for the turn, as does
getting back up from a prone position.

## All-Out Attack

A character can sacrifice her Defense for the turn in order
to gain a +2 to her attack with Brawl or Weaponry, throwing caution to the wind and leaving herself open to be more
aggressive. If she has already applied her Defense against an
attack before her action occurs, she can’t do an all-out attack.

## Offhand Attack

If a character attacks with her non-dominant hand,
whether because her dominant hand is injured, carrying
something, or otherwise occupied, or because she’s wielding two weapons at once, the player takes a -2 to her attack.

## Pulling Blows

Sometimes a character wants to beat the fight out of someone without killing him. She can choose to pull her blow,
not putting full force behind the attack. The player chooses a
maximum amount of damage for the blow that can’t exceed
the higher trait in her character’s attack pool — for example,
if the character has Strength 2 and Brawl 4, the player can
choose between 1 and 4 points as her maximum damage.
If she would deal more damage with the attack, any extra is
ignored. Because she’s holding back, it’s easier for the opponent to ward off the blow; the defender gains +1 to Defense.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, a character can reflexively
spend a point of Willpower when pulling her blow with a
weapon to deal bashing damage. Otherwise, the only way to
avoid dealing lethal damage is to stop using a lump of metal
or wood to inflict trauma.

## Specified Targets

Attacking specific body parts has its benefits. In addition
to ignoring armor, strikes to the limbs
and head can have added effects, represented by Tilts. These attacks take dice penalties depending on the
body part targeted, noted below.

• **Arm** (-2): A damaging hit can inflict the Arm Wrack
Tilt if it deals more damage than the target’s Stamina

• **Leg** (-2): A damaging hit can inflict the Leg Wrack Tilt
if it deals more damage than the target’s Stamina

• **Head** (-3): A damaging attack can inflict the Stunned
Tilt if it deals at least as much damage as the target’s Size

• **Heart** (-3): If the attacker does at least five points of
damage, the weapon pierces the opponent’s heart,
with special effects for some monstrous targets

• **Hand** (-4): On a damaging hit, the victim suffers the
Arm Wrack Tilt

• **Eye** (-5): On a damaging hit, the victim suffers the
Blinded Tilt

## Killing Blow

A character can make a killing blow when her opponent
is unconscious, completely immobile, or otherwise totally
defenseless. When doing so, the character deals damage equal
to her full dice pool plus her weapon modifier. She has time
enough to line up her attack so it avoids her victim’s armor.

While people who kill in combat can justify their actions
based on the heat of the moment, performing a killing blow is a premeditated attempt to end a sentient life without the
target having a chance to do anything about it. Going through
with a killing blow is a breaking point whether the victim
survives or not.
