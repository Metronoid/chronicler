# Violence

Everybody wants something. Drama happens when
characters want things that are mutually exclusive. A vampire
wants to drink the local bartender dry, but the bartender
wants to go on with her life and raise her daughter in peace.
A street gang wants to stake its claim to a neighborhood,
but another gang wants the same territory and isn’t willing
to share. An ex-con wants to turn his life around, but his
addictions keep dragging him back to old habits. It’s all
conflict, and conflict is what stories are all about.

When conflict is so irreconcilable that words and compromise aren’t enough to resolve it, violence breaks out. In the
Chronicles of Darkness, violence breaks out a lot. Monsters
prey on unsuspecting victims, creating vengeful survivors.
People see things they can’t deal with and lash out against
what they don’t understand. Horrors that lurk behind the
world’s facade of picket fences war with each other, and the
ripples throw lives into chaos. Inevitably, something calls the
characters to fight, even if it’s just for survival. This section
presents rules for resolving violent conflict.

## Combat Summary Chart

**STAGE ONE: INTENT**
• The players and the Storyteller describe what their characters want out of the fight.

• Decide whether characters can surrender and become Beaten Down.

**STAGE TWO: INITIATIVE**
• If the attacker springs an ambush or otherwise strikes when the defender isn’t able to counter, the defender rolls Wits + Composure contested by the attacker’s Dexterity + Stealth. If the defender fails, she doesn’t
act on the first turn of combat and cannot apply Defense against attacks.

• Everyone rolls Initiative: the result of a single die roll + Dexterity + Composure. If the character has a
weapon readied, apply its Initiative Modifier.

**STAGE THREE: ATTACK**
• Unarmed Combat: Strength + Brawl - opponent’s Defense

• Melee Combat: Strength + Weaponry - opponent’s Defense

• Ranged Combat: Dexterity + Firearms

• Thrown Weapons: Dexterity + Athletics - opponent’s Defense

A character’s Defense is normally subtracted from any attack dice pools where it applies. If she chooses to
Dodge, the defender rolls double her Defense as a dice pool against each attack. Each success reduces
the attacker’s successes by one. If the attacker is reduced to zero successes, the attack does nothing. If the
attacker has successes remaining, add any weapon modifier to the number of successes to determine how
many points of Health the target loses. All weapons deal lethal damage.

**STAGE FOUR: DESCRIPTION**
The Storyteller describes the attack and wounds in narrative terms.

**POSSIBLE MODIFIERS**
• **Aiming**: +1 per turn to a +3 maximum.

• **All-Out Attack**: +2 with Brawl or Weaponry attack; lose Defense.

• **Armor Piercing**: Ignores amount of target’s armor equal to item’s rating.

• **Autofire Long Burst**: 20 or so bullets, no target limit pending Storyteller approval. A +3 applies to each
attack roll; -1 per roll for each target after the first.

• **Autofire Medium Burst**: 10 or so bullets at one to three targets, with a +2 to each attack roll; -1 per roll for
each target after the first.

• **Autofire Short Burst**: Three bullets at a single target with a +1 to the roll.

• **Charge**: Move at twice Speed and attack with Brawl or Weaponry in one action; lose Defense.

• **Concealment**: Barely -1; partially -2; substantially -3; fully, see “Cover.”

• **Cover**: Subtract Durability from damage; if Durability is greater than the weapon modifier, the attack has
no effect.

• **Dodge**: Double Defense, roll as a dice pool with each success subtracting one from the attacker’s
successes.

• **Drawing a Weapon**: Requires instant action without a Merit and could negate Defense.

• **Firing from Concealment**: Shooter’s own concealment quality (-1, -2, or -3) reduced by 1 as a penalty to
fire back (so, no modifier, -1, or -2).

• **Offhand Attack**: -2 to attack roll.

• **Prone Target**: -2 to hit in ranged combat; +2 to hit within close-combat distance.

• **Pulling Blow**: Target gains 1 Defense; the attack can’t deal more than chosen maximum damage.

• **Range**: -2 at medium range, -4 at long range.

• **Shooting into Close Combat**: -2 per combatant avoided in a single shot (not applicable to autofire); -4 if
grappling.

• **Specified Target**: Torso -1, leg or arm -2, head -3, hand -4, eye -5.

• **Surprised or Immobilized Target**: Defense doesn’t apply.

• **Touching a Target**: Dexterity + Brawl or Dexterity + Weaponry; armor may or may not apply, but Defense
does apply.

• **Willpower**: Add three dice to a roll or +2 to a Resistance trait (Stamina, Resolve, or Composure) in one
roll or instance.
