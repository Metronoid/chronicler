# Initiative

When a fight’s inevitable, it helps to know who acts first.
Time in combat is always tracked in turns, and one turn includes one action for each character in the scene. At the start
of a violent conflict or other dramatic encounter in which
it’s important or easier to have characters act one at a time,
determine each character’s Initiative by rolling one die and
adding her Initiative modifier.

The Storyteller should write down each character’s
Initiative and put them in order, including both player characters and Storyteller characters. The Initiative order determined
here is the order in which the characters will act during each
turn until something happens to change it, such as a character
dropping a weapon (see below). Characters with high Initiative
react quickly and get the jump on the others, while characters
with low Initiative are hesitant, indecisive, or just slow to act.
Each turn, the Storyteller should take a moment to describe
how the lay of the land has changed since the last turn.

Lining up a shot or hefting a baseball bat takes more
effort than just swinging a fist. When a character is using a
weapon, apply its Initiative penalty for as long as she’s got
the weapon ready. The only way to avoid this modifier is to
sling it or drop it. Dropping a weapon is a reflexive action,
but picking it back up takes an instant action, as does just
drawing a weapon normally. A character wielding two weapons subtracts the largest Initiative penalty from her score,
and then reduces it by a further one. Wielding a crowbar
(Initiative penalty -2) and a riot shield (Initiative penalty -4)
thus applies a -5 to the roll.

## Delaying Actions

A player may not want his character to act when his
Initiative says he should. Maybe he can’t see his opponent
yet, or wants to see how someone will react to the changing
landscape of the fight before he does anything else. The player
can choose to delay his character’s action, waiting for a better
moment to act later in the turn. He can alert the Storyteller
that he wants to take his delayed action at any time during the
turn. If he does so, his place in the Initiative order changes
to the new delayed one for the rest of the fight.

If a player delays his character’s action for so long that
the next turn begins — thus sacrificing his action for that turn entirely — he may act at any time during the next turn,
but for subsequent turns his Initiative resets to what it was
before he delayed his action.

## Surprise

Characters who don’t realize they’re about to be on the
receiving end of bloody violence have a chance to notice the
ambush by rolling Wits + Composure, contested by the attacker’s
Dexterity + Stealth. Any character who fails the roll cannot take
an action in the first turn of combat, and can’t apply Defense
for that turn. Determine Initiative in the second turn as normal.
