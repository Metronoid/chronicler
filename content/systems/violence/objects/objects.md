# Objects

In the Storytelling system, objects such as lead pipes, walls,
or wardrobes have three traits: Durability, Size, and Structure.
Mostly, these relate to how easy the object is to destroy.

**Durability**: How hard the object is to damage. Subtract
Durability from any damage dealt to the object. Durability
has no effect against attacks that deal aggravated damage.

<table class="table-auto">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Durability</th>
      <th>Material</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Wood, hard plastic, thick glass</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Stone, aluminum</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Steel, iron</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+1</td>
      <td>Per reinforced layer</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Size**: How large the object is. Objects smaller than Size 1
can fit entirely in a person’s palm. See p. 26 for the Size chart.

**Structure**: An object’s Structure equals its Durability +
Size, and acts like Health. Each point of damage removes a
point of Structure. Once it’s taken more damage than it has
Durability, anyone using the object suffers a one-die penalty.
When its Structure hits 0, the object is destroyed. Objects do
not differentiate between bashing and lethal damage.
